Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
