Like so many of my favorite batch cooking basics, this Tuscan beef stew is one of those recipes that just keeps on giving. Be the first to review this recipe. I believe this recipe was passed down from my Grandma. I think it&#39;s interesting how the tapioca is used to thicken the stew. I recently took it to a fundraiser for charity and it was the only stew/soup that was gone by the end of the day. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
