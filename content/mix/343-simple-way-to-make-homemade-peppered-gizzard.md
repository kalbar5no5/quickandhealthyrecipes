Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
