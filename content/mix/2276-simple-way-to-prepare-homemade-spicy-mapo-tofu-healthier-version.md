Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest.
