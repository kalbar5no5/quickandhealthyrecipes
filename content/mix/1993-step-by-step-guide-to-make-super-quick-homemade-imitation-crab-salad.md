Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
