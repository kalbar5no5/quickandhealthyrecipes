Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
