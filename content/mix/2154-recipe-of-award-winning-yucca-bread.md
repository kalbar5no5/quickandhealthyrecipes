Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
