Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
