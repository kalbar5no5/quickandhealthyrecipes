How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
