Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
