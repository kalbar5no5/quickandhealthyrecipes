Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
