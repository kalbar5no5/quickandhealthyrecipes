Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
