Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
