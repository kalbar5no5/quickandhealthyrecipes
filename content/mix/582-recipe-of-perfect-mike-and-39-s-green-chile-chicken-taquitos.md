recipeinstructions:
- "Here&#39;s about all you&#39;ll need."
- "Rinse breasts and trim fat."
- "Add 32 oz box Chicken Broth to a pot and add chicken breasts. Add additional water to fully cover breasts if needed. Cover and boil on high until breasts are fully cooked. Add additional water as needed during boil time."
- "At about 35 minutes boiling time, peirce the thickest part of your largest chicken breast with a knife. If it&#39;s fluids run pink, boil longer. Clear? You&#39;re good to go!"
- "Pull breasts from pot with tongs and allow to cool slightly, but not totally. You&#39;ll want that moisture in your heated chicken upon mixing in your dried seasonings."
- "Finely shread chicken breasts with 2 forks in a large bowl. Discard any fat or anything unsightly."
- "° Add everything in the Taquito Seasonings section - except for reserves and 4 tablespoons of your 16 oz bucket Bueno Green Hatch Chile - and mix well. Drain fluids but, definitely reserve them. You&#39;ll need all of that delicious roasted green chile moisture in your shredded chicken mixture. But, not in your upcoming easy enchilada sauce. If, you choose to make that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ° If choosing NOT to make the enchilada sauce dip, add all chiles and chile fluids to your chicken mixture and mix well."
- "Place seasoned shreadded chicken in your tortillas. Tightly roll up these tortillas as you&#39;ll want them moist upon service. Pin with 1 toothpick. As pictured in photo #2 below."
- "° Place taquitos on a lightly sprayed foil lined cookie sheet. I&#39;ll also pack my remaining chicken mixture to the empty ends of my taquitos. See comparable pictures below.                                                                          ° Add shreadded cheese to the tops. Garnish with dried Cilantro and Chives if you&#39;d like.                                                                                ° Since your chicken mixture is already cooked, bake taquitos at 350° until tortillas are crispy and browned and cheese is melted. About 25 - 30 minutes.                                                         ° Bake on a lifted rack if not serving immediately. They&#39;ll be crisper. Especially on the bottoms."
- "If you&#39;d like a less crispy baked taquito, lightly brush a cilantro infused or plain olive oil on the tops of your taquitos, place cheese on top, then bake."
- "IMPORTANT NOTE!                                                     Pull all toothpicks after baking or frying."
- "Add your 4 tablespoons Bueno Green Chile to your two 10 oz cans of green enchilada sauce and heat. Use this as an easy, delicious dip option. Or, just follow this easy recipe.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/349604-mikes-1-minute-green-chile-enchilada-sauce"
- "° Personally, the most of us here prefer these taquitos without any side condiments whatsoever. The intense flavor of the chicken and broth, Hatch Chiles and Cumin are plenty enough flavor on their own. ° However, serve your taquitos immediately from your oven with chilled sour cream, salsa, guacamole and, your warmed green chili enchilada sauce to the side. Know that options are always appreciated by your guests!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/345482-mikes-fiesta-guacamole"
- "If choosing to deep fry your spicy shredded chicken taquitos, follow the exact same recipe directions. But, instead of baking, place 2&#34; inches of vegetable oil in a large pan and fry them for about 2 minutes. Or, until taquitos are crispy and golden brown. Flip taquitos once during fry time then, drain well on absorbant paper towels."
- "The best way I know to reheat these. A Toast-R-Oven. The tortillas will crisp right back up and the chicken will be just as juicy."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
