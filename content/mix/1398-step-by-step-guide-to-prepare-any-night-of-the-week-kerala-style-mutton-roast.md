Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
