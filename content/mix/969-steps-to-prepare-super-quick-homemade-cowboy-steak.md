Thick-cut steaks are reverse seared on the Traeger for a flavor injection, then topped with a zesty, herb-packed gremolata for a fresh finish. Before you get too confused, we&#39;ll come right out and say it: the cowboy steak is technically a bone-in ribeye. There are several names for it, including cowboy New York steak, tomahawk steak, Delmonico, or even &#34;rugged cowboy.&#34; Whatever name you decide to give it, we like to go with the cowboy or tomahawk steak. Season all over with salt and pepper; Meanwhile, make cowboy butter: In a medium bowl, combine all cowboy butter. Extra thick cut bone-in ribeye cowboy steak is always a delicious steak choice, prized for its tenderness and flavor. 

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
