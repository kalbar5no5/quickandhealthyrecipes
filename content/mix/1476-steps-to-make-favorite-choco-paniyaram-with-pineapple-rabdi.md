Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
