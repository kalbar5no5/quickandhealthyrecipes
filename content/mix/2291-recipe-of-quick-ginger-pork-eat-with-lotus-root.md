How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
