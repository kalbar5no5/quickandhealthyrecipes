Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
