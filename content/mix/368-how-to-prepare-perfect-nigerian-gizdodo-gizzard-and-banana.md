Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
