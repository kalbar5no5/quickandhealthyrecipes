Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
