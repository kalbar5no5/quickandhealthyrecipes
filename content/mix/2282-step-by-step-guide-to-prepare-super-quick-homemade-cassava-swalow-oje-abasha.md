Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
