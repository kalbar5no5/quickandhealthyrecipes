Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
