How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
