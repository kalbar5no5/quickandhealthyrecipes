Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
