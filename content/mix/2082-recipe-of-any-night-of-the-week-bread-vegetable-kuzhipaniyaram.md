Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
