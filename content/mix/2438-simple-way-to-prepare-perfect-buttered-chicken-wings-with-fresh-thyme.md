Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
