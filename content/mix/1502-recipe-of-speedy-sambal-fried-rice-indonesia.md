This fried rice dish is loosely based on an Indonesian (Javanese) rice dish called nasi goreng. It&#39;s delicious and simple, consisting of stir-fried rice with a zippy flavoring paste, spiced with sambal, and finished with kepac manis (a sweet Indonesian soy sauce). It&#39;s spicier and more assertive than your typical Chinese fried rice. Sambal is a generic term for chili-based sauces.

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
