Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
