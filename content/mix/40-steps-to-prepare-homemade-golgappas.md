Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
