Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
