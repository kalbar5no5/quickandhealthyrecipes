Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
