recipeingredient:
- "6 beef short ribs"
- "1 large onion sliced"
- "6 cloves garlic roughly chopped"
- "2 tbsp fish sauce"
- "8 cups beef stock"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "6 tbsp peanut butter smooth or crunchy your choice"
- "1/2 lb green beans ends trimmed"
- "1 bundle kale destemmed and cut into large strips"
- "1 tbsp sauteed shrimp paste optional"
- "1/2 tbsp white vinegar optional"
- "1/2 tbsp maple syrup optional"
- "1 Serrano chili chopped optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season the ribs lightly with salt and pepper, then sear them in a large pot on high heat with a splash of veg oil. Once they&#39;re browned, remove them to a bowl and set aside."
- "Add the onion and garlic to the pot and fry for one minute. Add the fish sauce and let cook another minute. Add the beef stock and bay leaves and return the ribs to the pot (along with any juices). Turn the heat down to low, cover and let simmer for 2 hours. Be sure to skim the surface regularly because the ribs will give off a lot of oil and floaty gunk (sorry, don&#39;t know the right term for it)."
- "Once the ribs are soft pull them aside and let them cool. You can keep the pot simmering uncovered so the broth can reduce. When the ribs are cool enough to handle, clean the meat off the bones. Try to keep the meat as intact as possible. Remove the bay leaves from the pot and add the meat back in."
- "Stir the peanut butter into the pot. Once it&#39;s melted in, add the green beans and kale. Let simmer for 10 more minutes then serve with rice and shrimp paste (optional, step 5)."
- "In a small pot on low heat, add the shrimp paste, vinegar, maple syrup, and chili. Let it warm through, then serve on the side."

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
