Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
