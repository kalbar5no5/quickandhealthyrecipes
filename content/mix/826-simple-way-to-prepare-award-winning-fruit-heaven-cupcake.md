Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
