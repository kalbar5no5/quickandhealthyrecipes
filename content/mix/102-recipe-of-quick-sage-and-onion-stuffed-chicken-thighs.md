Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
