Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
