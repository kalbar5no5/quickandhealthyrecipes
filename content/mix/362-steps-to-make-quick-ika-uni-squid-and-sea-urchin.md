Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
