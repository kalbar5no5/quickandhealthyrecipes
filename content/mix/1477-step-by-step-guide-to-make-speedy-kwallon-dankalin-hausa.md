Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
