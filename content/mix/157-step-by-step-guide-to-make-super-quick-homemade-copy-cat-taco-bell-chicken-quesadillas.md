Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
