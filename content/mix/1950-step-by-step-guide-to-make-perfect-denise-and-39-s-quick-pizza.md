Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
