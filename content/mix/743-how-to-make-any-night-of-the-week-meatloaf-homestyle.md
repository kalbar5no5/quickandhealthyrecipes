How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
