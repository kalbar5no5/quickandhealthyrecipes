Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body.
