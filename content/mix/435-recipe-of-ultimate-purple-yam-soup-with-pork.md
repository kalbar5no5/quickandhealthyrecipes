Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
