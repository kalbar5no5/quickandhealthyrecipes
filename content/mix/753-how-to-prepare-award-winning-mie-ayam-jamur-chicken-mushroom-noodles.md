Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
