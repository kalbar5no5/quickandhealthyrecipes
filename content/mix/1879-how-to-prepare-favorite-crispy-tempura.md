Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
