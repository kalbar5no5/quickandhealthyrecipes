Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
