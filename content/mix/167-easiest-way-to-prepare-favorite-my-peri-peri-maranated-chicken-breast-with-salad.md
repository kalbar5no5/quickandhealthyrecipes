Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
