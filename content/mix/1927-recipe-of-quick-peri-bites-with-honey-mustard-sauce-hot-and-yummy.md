Because honey and Mustard sausages are amazing if you haven&#39;t had them already. Three: Pour the honey and mustard sauce over the vegetables and mix well. I wouldn&#39;t recommend freezing and reheating the leftovers, as once the vegetables are defrosted they can get a bit limp. This honey mustard sauce is ridiculously easy and transforms the ordinary into extraordinary. hot sauce, garlic powder, soy sauce, butter, honey.

I wouldn&#39;t recommend freezing and reheating the leftovers, as once the vegetables are defrosted they can get a bit limp. This honey mustard sauce is ridiculously easy and transforms the ordinary into extraordinary. hot sauce, garlic powder, soy sauce, butter, honey. The sauce this recipe produces is fairly mild. If you would like a more intensely honey-mustard sauce, double up on the apple cider/mustard/honey mixture Once the oil is hot add the chicken breasts to the pan. Spoon sauce over chicken and apples and sprinkle with parsley. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
