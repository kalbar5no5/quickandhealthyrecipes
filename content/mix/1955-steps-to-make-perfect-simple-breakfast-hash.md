Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
