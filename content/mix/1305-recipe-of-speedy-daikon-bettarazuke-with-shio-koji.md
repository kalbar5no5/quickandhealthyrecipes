Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
