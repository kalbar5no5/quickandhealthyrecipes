Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
