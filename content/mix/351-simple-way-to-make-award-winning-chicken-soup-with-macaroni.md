Elbow Macaroni Chicken Noodle Soup We always keep DeLallo pasta stocked in the pantry, and chicken in the freezer, so quickly I pulled carrots, celery, onion, fennel, and fresh dill from the fridge and started chopping! Heat the oil and quickly saute the chicken and vegetables until they are lightly colored. Stir in the stock and herbs. Bring to a boil and add pasta.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
