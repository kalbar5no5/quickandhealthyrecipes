Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
