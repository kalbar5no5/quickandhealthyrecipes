Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
