Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
