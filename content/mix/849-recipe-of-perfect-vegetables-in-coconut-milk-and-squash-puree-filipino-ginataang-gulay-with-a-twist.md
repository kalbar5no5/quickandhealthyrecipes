How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
