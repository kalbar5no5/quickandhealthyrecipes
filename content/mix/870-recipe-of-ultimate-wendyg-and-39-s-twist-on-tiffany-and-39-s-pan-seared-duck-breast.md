Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
