Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
