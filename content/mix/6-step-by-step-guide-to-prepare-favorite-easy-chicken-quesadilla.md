Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
