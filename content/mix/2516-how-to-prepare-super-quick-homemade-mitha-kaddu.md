How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
