Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
