How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
