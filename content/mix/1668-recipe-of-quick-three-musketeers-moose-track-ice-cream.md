How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
