Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
