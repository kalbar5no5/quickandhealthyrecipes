Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
