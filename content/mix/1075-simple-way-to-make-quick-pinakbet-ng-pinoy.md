Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
