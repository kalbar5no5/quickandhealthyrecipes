recipeingredient:
- "2 lb ground beef"
- "3 large chopped zucchini"
- "1 cup grated carrot"
- "1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper"
- "1 cup finely chopped sweet yellow onion"
- "4 clove garlic finely chopped or pressed"
- "6 oz can of tomato sauce of any kind I used El Pato which is a spicier red sauce you can find in the hispanic food section of your grocery store"
- "1 1/2 cup Minute White rice"
- "1 1/2 cup water"
- "2 tsp tomato chicken bouillon"
- "1 tbsp of tomato paste"
- "1/2 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1 cup shredded cheese of any kind I used monterey jack but cheddar is amazing as well"
- "4 large green bell peppers cut in half and cleaned out"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large microwavable container, add rice, warm water, bouillon, tomato paste and pepper. Make sure paste is well incorporated into the rice mixture. It helps if your water is warm, then you can dissolve your bouillon and paste before adding to rice. Once mixed, place in microwave with lid slightly covering but not closed and microwave for about 5 mins. Let rice sit for another 5 mins or until liquid is dissolved and rice is tender to fluff with a fork."
- "Set aside rice mixture with lid on to stay warm and in a Large Pan, add about a tbs of olive oil and start cooking down onion, garlic, carrots, red bell pepper and zucchini. Cook on about Medium temperature until vegetables are tender but not over cooked. You want them to keep their shape when incorporating all ingredients. Remove from pan &amp; set aside."
- "In the same pan, start cooking your ground beef until well browned. Approximately 5mins. Drain all fat from beef with a spoon. Adjust your temperature to med low and add your cooked vegetables and the can of tomato sauce. Fold in all ingredients and simmer on low for about 5 mins more."
- "Turn off stove and allow mixture to cool down. Taking your green bell peppers, cut in half so they create little cups and can stand up on their own on the pan. Remove core, stems and all seeds. Using any large baking dish, cover entire bottom in foil to eliminate messy cleanup. Place all pepper halves on bottom about 1/2 inch away from each other"
- "Preheat oven to 375°F"
- "Take beef and vegetable mixture and in a large bowl mix into rice. Fold ingredients together as to not mush up rice or break down vegetables. This is the seasoning stage. Adjust flavors to your preferences by adding more salt or herbs if you choosing. Once everything is mixed well, start filling pepper halves by pushing down rice/meat mixture until they are fully filled. You may have extra filling which is always yummy on it&#39;s own. :)"
- "Once all pepper halves are completed, pile on shredded cheese. Cover entire pan and peppers with foil trying not to touch tops of peppers. Make sure there is a slit on the top for steam. Place in oven and cook for about 30 mins. During the last 5 mins, remove foil and allow cheese to brown."
- "I serve these on their own with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. You can change up the recipe and add mushrooms if desired or even substitute white rice for brown. I made a low carb version without rice and used 3lbs of ground beef and a pound of lean sausage instead. The possibilities are endless. I hope you enjoy!"

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
