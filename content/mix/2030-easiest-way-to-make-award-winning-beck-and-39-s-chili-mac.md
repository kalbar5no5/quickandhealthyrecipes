How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
