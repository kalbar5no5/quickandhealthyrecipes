How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
