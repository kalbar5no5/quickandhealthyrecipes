Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
