Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a special dish, cheese toast. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Cheese Toast is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. Cheese Toast is something which I have loved my entire life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

In a medium bowl, combine the Cheddar, Monterey Jack, mayonnaise, Parmesan, butter, salt, pepper and seasoned salt. Cut the loaf in half lengthwise, then into thirds or fourths. Better yet, you&#39;ll need just need four ingredients for crisp Cheese Toast. &#34;My mom came up with this recipe when I was growing up,&#34; Eve shares. &#34;The tangy triangles broil to a pretty golden color in just minutes. Try sourdough for a tangy flavor, or an airy bread like ciabatta if you like the cheese oozing through the holes and burning on the pan.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook cheese toast using 6 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

Spread with your desired amount of butter. Place cheese on top of butter. Grate the Cheddar cheese using a large hole grater ―if you use a small hole, the cheese will melt too quickly before the bread has toasted. Divide the cheese between two slices of bread, placing it on the unbuttered side.

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
