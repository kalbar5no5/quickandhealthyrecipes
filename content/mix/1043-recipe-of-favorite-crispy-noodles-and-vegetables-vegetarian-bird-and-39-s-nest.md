Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
