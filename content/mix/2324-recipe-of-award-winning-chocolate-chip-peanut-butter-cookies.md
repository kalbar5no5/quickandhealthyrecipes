Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
