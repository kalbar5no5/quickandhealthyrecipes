Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
