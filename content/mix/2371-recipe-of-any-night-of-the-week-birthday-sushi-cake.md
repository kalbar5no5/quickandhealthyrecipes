Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
