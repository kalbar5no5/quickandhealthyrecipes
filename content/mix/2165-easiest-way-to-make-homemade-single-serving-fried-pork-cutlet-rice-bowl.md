recipeinstructions:
- "If the tonkatsu is cold, slice up and heat in a toaster oven until the breading is crispy."
- "If you are heating up the cutlet, time it so that it will be hot when the sauce is ready. The rice bowl will taste better if everything that&#39;s in it is served piping-hot."
- "Slice the onion thinly (so it cooks through well)."
- "Beat the eggs. (Don&#39;t totally mix the yolk and white together! Just beat lightly as if you&#39;re cutting through the white!)"
- "In a small pan, heat the onion and the ingredients marked ◎."
- "Heat until it&#39;s bubbling, turn down the heat to medium-low (until it&#39;s bubbling slightly) and simmer for 2-3 minutes."
- "While the sauce is still simmering, portion out your steaming hot rice in a bowl."
- "Heat the cutlets in the pan and pour in about 2/3 of the egg mixture (don&#39;t pour it all in; leave about a third of the mixture for later)."
- "Turn up the heat slightly and cook while shaking the pan occasionally until the egg is about half set, then add the rest of the beaten egg mixture."
- "Continue cooking while shaking the pan until the egg you added last is just about soft set. Gently pour on top of the rice and it&#39;s done."
- "The soft creamy egg and the sweet-savory sauce mixes with the rice and it&#39;s so good! I use homemade chicken cutlets for this."

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
