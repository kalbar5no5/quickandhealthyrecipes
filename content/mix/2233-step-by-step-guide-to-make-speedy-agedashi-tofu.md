Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
