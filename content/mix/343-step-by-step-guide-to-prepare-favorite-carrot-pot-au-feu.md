##### The ingredients needed to make Carrot Pot-au-feu:

1. Take 5 chiken wing
1. Make ready 1 carrot

Just cut your favorite vegetables and meat, and simmer in broth. The point is to cut ingredients in large sizes. This classic French comfort dish is stewed meats with vegetables, but the difference is the dish can be served in at least two if not three ways: The marrow is removed from the bone and spread on toast as a starter, the broth is served as a soup, and the meat is plated with the vegetables. Ours is traditional of tender beef and chicken braised in a rich bouillon with a melange of fresh vegetables - onions, leeks, carrots, celery, cabbage and red bliss potatoes.

This classic French comfort dish is stewed meats with vegetables, but the difference is the dish can be served in at least two if not three ways: The marrow is removed from the bone and spread on toast as a starter, the broth is served as a soup, and the meat is plated with the vegetables. Ours is traditional of tender beef and chicken braised in a rich bouillon with a melange of fresh vegetables - onions, leeks, carrots, celery, cabbage and red bliss potatoes. Bring to a boil over moderate heat; as the stock begins to boil, carefully. Pot-au-feu (/ ˌ p ɒ t oʊ ˈ f ɜːr /; French: [pɔt‿o fø] (); &#34;pot on the fire&#34;) is a French beef stew. According to the chef Raymond Blanc, pot-au-feu is &#34;the quintessence of French family cuisine; it is the most celebrated dish in France and considered a national dish. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
