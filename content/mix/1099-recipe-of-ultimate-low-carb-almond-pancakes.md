Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
