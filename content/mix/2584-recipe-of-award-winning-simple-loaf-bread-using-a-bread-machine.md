Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
