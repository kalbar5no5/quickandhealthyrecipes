Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
