Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
