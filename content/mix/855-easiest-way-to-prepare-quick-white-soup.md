Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
