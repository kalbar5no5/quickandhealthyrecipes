Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
