Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
