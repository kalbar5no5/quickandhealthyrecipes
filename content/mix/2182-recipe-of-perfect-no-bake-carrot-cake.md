Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
