Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
