Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
