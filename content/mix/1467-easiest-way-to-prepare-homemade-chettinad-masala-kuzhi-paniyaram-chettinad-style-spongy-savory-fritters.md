Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
