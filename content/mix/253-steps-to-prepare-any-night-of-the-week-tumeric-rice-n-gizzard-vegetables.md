Stir in the rice, turmeric, and curry powder, mixing well to coat the rice with the spices and oil. Add the raisins, vegetable stock and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Also I was running low on tumeric so I only used a teaspoon but that seemed fine for us and still gave the rice a bright beautiful color. In a small bowl, whisk together together oil, garlic, lemon juice, turmeric, and sea salt. Place sauce in a container or ziplock bag, add vegetables and shake to coat. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
