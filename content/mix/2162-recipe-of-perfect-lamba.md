Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood.

The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine.
