Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
