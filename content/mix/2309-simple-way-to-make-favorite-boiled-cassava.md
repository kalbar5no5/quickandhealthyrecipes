Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts.

Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
