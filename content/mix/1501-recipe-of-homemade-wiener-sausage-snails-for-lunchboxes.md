Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
