Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
