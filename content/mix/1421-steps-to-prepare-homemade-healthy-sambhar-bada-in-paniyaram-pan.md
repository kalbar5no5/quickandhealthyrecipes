Garnished with coriander leaves, grated carrots and sometimes kara boondhi, tempered with curry leaves and mustard seeds, this is a savory dahi.

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
