Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
