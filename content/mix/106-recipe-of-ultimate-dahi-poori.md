Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!
