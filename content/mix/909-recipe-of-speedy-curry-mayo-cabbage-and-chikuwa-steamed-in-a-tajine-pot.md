Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
