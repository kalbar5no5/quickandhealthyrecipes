Not only did I found some really great, simple microwave vegetable recipes, I also found something that surprised me: Cooking in the microwave can be nutritionally beneficial. I think I&#39;ll stay away from nuking a whole chicken but, when it comes to quick-cooking vegetables, the microwave can be a handy, no-guilt kitchen tool. The big difference between vegan mayonnaise and traditional mayo really comes down to the egg substitute. &#34;We use vegetable proteins in place of eggs,&#34; explains Bob Goldberg, cofounder of Follow Your Heart , the manufacturer of one of the OG vegan mayonnaises Vegenaise. This is the best (and safe) way to cook vegetables in the microwave. 

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
