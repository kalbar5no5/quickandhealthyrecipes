Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
