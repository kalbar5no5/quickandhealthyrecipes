Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
