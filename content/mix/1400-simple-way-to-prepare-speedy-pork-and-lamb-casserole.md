Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
