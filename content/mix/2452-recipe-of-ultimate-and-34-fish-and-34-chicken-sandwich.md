Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
