Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
