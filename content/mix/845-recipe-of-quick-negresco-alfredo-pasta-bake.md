Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
