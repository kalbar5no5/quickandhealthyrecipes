How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
