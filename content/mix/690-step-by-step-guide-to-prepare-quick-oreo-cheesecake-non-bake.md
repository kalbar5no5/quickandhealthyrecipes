Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
