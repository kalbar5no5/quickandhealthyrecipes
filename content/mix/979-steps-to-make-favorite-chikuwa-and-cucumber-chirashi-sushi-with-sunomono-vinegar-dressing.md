Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body.
