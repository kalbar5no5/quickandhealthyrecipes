How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
