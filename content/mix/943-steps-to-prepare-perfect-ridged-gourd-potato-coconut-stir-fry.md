Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
