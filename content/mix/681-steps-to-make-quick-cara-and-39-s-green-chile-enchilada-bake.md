Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
