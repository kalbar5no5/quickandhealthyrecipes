Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
