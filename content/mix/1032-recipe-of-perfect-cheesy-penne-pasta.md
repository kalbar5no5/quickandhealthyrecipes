Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
