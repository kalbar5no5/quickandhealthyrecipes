Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
