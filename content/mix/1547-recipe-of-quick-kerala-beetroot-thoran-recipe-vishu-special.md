Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
