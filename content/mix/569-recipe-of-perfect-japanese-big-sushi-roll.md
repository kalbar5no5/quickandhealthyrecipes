Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
