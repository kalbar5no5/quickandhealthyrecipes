Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
