Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
