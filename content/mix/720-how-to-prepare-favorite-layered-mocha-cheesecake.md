Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
