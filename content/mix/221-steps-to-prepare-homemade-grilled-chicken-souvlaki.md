How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
