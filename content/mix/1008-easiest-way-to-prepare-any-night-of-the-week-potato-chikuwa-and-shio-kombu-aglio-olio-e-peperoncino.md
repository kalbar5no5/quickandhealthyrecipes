Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
