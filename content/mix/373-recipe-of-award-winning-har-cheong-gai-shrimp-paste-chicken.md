Shrimp Paste Chicken is a uniquely Singaporean way of cooking deep-fried chicken! Regular batter is replaced with a special shrimp paste batter, so that the wing packs a punch full of flavour. My first taste of it was at the Loy Sum Juan Restaurant, located at Pearl&#39;s Hill (Outram) years ago (a place that probably only old-timers would remember). Har Cheong Gai is first marinated and then dipped into a batter or dusted with a flour mixture and left to marinade overnight before deep frying it the following day. WARNING: The moment you open the bottle of Shrimp Paste, the smell will &#34;stink up&#34; the whole house so ensure that you close all the rooms&#39; doors and open your windows. 

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
