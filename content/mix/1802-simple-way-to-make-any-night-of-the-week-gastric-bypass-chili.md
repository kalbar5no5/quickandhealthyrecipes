Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
