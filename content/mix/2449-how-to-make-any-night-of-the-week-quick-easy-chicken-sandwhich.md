Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
