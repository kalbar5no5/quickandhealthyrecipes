Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
