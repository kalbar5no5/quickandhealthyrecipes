Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
