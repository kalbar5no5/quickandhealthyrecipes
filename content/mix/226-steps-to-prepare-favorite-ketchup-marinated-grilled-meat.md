I combined it with some ketchup, dry yellow mustard, paprika, garlic, apple cider vinegar, and garlic. I marinated boneless chicken breasts, but I think this would work well on pork or beef as well. I also used Coca Cola Classic, but I think Dr. Pepper or Cherry Coke might be good too.

I also used Coca Cola Classic, but I think Dr. Pepper or Cherry Coke might be good too. Just DON&#39;T use dietâ€¦it doesn&#39;t contain sugar. As well, make sure to flip the meat frequently while grilling. Since lean pork loin meat gets dry and chalky pretty quickly, try not to overcook. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
