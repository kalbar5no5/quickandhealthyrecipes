Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
