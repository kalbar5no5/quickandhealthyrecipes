Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
