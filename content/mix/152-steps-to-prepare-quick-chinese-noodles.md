Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
