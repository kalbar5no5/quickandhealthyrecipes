How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
