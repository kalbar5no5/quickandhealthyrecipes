Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
