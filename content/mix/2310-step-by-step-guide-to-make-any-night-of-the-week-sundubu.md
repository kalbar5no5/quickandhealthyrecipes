Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
