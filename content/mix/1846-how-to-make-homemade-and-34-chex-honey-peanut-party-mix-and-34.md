Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
