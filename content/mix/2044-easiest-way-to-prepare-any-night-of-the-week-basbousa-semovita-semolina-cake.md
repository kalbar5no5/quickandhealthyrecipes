Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
