Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
