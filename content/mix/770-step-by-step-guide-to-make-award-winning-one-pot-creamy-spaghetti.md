Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
