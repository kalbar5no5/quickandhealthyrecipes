Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
