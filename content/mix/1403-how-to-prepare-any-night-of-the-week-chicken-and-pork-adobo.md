Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
