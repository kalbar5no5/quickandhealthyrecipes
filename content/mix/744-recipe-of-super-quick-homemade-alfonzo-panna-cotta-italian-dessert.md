Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
