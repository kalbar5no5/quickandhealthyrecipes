Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
