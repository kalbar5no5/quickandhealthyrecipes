Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
