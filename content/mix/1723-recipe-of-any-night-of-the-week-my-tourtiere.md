Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
