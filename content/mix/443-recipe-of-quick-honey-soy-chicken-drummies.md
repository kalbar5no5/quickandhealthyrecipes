Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
