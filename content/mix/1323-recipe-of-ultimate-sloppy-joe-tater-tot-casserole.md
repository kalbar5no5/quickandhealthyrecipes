Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
