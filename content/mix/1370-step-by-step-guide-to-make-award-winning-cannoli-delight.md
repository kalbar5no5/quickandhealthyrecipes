Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
