Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
