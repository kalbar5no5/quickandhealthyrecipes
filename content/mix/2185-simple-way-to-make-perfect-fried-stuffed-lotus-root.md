Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
