Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
