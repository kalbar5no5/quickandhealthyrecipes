Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
