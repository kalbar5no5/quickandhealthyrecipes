Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
