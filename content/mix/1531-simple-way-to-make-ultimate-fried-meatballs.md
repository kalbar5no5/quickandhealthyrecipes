Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
