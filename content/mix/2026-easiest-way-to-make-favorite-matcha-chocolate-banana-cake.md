Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
