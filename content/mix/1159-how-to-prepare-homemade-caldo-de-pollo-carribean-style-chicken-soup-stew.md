Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
