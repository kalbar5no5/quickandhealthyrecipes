Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
