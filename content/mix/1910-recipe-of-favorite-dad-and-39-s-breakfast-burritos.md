Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
