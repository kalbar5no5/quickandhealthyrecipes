Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
