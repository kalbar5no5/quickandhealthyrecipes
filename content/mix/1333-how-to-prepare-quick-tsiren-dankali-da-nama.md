Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
