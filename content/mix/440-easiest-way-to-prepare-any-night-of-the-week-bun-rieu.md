How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
