Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
