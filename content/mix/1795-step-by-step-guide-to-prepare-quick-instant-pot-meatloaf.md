Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
