How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
