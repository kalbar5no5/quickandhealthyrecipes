How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
