Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
