Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
