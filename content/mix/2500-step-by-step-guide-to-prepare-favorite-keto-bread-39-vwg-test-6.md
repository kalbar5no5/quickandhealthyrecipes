How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
