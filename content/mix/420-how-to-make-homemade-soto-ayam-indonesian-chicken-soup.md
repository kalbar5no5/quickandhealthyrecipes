Soto ayam is chicken noodle soup - Indonesian style. My soto ayam recipe for the Indonesian chicken noodle soup is based on the Yogyakarta breakfast noodle soup, an aromatic chicken broth with rice noodles, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, shallots, ginger, coriander, turmeric, and cloves, that&#39;s eaten with deep fried shallots lime juice, and spicy sambal soto. Soto ayam, an Indonesian version of chicken soup, is a clear herbal broth brightened by fresh turmeric and herbs, with skinny rice noodles buried in the bowl. It is served with a boiled egg, fried.

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
