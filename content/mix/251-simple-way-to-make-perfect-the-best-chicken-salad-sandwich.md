Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
