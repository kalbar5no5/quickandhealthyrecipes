Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
