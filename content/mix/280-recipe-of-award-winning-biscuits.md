Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
