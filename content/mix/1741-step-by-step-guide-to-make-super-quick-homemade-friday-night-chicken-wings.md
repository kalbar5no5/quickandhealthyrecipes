Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
