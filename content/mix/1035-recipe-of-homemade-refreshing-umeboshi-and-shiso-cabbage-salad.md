Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
