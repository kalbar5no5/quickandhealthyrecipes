Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
