Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
