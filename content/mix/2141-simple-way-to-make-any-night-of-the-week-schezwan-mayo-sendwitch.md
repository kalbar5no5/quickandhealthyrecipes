Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
