Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
