Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
