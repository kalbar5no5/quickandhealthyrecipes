Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
