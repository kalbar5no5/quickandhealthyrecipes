Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
