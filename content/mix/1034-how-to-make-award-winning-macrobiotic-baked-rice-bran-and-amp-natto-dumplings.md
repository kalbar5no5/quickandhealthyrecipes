How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
