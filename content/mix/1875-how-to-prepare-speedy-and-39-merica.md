Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
