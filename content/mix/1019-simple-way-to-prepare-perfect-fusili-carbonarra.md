Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
