Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
