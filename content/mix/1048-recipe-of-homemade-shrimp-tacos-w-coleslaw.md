Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
