Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
