Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
