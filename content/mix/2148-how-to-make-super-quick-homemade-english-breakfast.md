The mushrooms are easily the most frequently messed up portion of the full English breakfast. Don&#39;t put some rubbery, squeaky, pizza-parlor-type mushrooms on my plate. Fried bread is one of the English breakfasts dirty little pleasures because its so greasy, but fried bread is brilliant with a fried egg on top and makes your breakfast deliciously crunchy. Fry two slices and put them on a plate to stay warm near the grill.

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
