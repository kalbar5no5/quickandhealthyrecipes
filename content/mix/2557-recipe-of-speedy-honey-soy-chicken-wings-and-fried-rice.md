How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
