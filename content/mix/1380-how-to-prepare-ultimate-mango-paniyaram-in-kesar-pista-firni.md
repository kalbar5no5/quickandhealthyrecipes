Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
