Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
