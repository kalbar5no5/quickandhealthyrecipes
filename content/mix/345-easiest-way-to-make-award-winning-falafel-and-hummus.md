Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
