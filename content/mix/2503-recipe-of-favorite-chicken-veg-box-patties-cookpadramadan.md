Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
