Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
