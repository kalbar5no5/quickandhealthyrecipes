Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
