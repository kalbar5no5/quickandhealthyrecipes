Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
