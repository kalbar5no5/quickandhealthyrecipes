Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
