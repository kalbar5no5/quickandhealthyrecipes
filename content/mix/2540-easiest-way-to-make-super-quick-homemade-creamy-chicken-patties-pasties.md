Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
