Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
