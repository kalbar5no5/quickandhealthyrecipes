Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
