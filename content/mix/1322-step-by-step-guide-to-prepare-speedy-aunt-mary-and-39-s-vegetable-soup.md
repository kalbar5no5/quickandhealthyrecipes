Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
