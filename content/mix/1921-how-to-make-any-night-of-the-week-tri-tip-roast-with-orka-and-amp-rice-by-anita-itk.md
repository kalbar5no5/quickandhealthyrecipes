Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
