Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
