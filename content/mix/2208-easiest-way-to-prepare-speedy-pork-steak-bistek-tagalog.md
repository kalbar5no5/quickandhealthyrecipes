Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
