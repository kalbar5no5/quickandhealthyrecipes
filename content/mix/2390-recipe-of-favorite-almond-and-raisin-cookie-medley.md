Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
