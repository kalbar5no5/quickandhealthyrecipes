Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
