Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
