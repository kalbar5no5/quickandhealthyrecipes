Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
