Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
