With the slightly sweet, somewhat salty, and subtly smoky flavor of the ham, this hearty soup is the ideal fall or winter soup -- a great one for lunches, or as a starter for dinner. By Chef John Sponsored By Food Wishes Pork pairs well with other ingredients, especially for these ham soup recipes, including corn chowder, ham and bean soup, ham and potato soup, sausage soup, ham and lentil soup, ham and split pea soup, ham chowder and more. It is very easy and the great thing about it is that you can add additional ingredients, more ham, potatoes, etc and it still turns out great. This excellent navy beans and ham soup is a real family favorite of ours and I make it often. —Mildred Lewis, Temple, Texas.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
