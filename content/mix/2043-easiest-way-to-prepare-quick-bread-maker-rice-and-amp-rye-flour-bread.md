Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
