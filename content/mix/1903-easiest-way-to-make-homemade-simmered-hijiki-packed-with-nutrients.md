Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
