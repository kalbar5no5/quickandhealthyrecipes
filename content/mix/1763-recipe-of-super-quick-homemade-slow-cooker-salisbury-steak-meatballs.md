Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
