Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
