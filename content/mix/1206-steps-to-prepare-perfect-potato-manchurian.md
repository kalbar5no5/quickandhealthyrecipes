Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
