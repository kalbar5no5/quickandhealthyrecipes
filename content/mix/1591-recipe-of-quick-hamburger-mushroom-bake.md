Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
