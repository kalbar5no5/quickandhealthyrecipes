Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
