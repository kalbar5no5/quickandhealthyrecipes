Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
