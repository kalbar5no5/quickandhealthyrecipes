Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
