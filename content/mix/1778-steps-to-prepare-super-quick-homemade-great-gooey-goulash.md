Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
