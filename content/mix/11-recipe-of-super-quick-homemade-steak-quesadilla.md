Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
