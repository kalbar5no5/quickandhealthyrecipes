Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
