Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
