Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
