Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
