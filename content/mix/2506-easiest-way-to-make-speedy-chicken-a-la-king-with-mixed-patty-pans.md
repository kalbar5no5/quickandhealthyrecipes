Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
