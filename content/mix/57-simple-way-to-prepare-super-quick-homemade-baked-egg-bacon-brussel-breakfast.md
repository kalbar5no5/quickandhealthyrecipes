How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
