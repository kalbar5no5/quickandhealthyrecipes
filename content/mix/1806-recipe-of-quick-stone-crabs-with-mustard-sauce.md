Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
