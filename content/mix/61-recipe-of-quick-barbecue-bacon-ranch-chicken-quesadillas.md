Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
