Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
