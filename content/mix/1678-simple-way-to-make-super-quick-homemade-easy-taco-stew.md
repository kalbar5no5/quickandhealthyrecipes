Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, easy!! taco stew. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Easy!! Taco Stew is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods on earth. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. They are fine and they look wonderful. Easy!! Taco Stew is something which I have loved my entire life.

Brown the beef and onion in a dutch oven, then drain. Add all ingredients to the beef/onion mixture, except for the tortilla chips and cheese. Cook over medium heat until thoroughly heated. TO SERVE: Crumble a handful of either tortilla chips or Doritos in individual serving bowls and cover with a generous helping of stew.


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook easy!! taco stew using 12 ingredients and 11 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Easy!! Taco Stew:

1. Take 1 Couple dashes of meat tenderizer, garlic salt, garlic powder, black pepper, onion powder
1. Get 1 lb ground beef
1. Take 1 can pinto beans or refried beans
1. Make ready 1 onion
1. Make ready 1 envelope taco seasoning
1. Get 1 can any kind of tomato sauce, I used garlic and herb sauce.
1. Prepare 1 cup water
1. Get 1 cheddar/colby jack cheese
1. Get 1 can corn
1. Prepare 2 medium russet potatoes (you dont have to use these)
1. Take 8 baby carrots (you can also choose not to use these..)
1. Prepare 1 bag of nacho cheese doritos or corn chips


Place the seasoned stew meat in a preheated skillet coated with olive oil to brown and once the meat is browned, add the onions. This easy taco stew is packed with protein and flavor and has no cheese or milk products. It&#39;s also so flavorful that my own family didn&#39;t miss putting cheese over the top. One thing I love about this chunky stew (other than that it&#39;s so darn easy) is the chunks of carrots and bell pepper keeping it fresh tasting and not.

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
