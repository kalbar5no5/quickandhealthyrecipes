Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
