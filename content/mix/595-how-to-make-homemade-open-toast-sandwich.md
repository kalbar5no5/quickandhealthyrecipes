How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
