Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
