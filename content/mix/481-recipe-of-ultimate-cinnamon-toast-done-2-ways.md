How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
