Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
