Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
