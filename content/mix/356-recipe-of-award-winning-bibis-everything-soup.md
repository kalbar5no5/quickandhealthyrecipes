Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
