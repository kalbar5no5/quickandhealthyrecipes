Somewhere between a pub with a lot of dishes, and restaurant with a lot (lot!) of drinks, is an izakaya. It&#39;s a type of casual Japanese dining establishment where groups of friends and coworkers. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
