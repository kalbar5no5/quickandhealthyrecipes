Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
