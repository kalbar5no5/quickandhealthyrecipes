Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
