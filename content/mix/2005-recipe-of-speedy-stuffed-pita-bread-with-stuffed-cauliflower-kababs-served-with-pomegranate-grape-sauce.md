Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
