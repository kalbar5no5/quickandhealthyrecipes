Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
