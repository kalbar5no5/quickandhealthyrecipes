Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
