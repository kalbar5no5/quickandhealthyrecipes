This stunning winter salad gets its sweet, earthy flavor from roasted beets and balsamic vinegar. Creamy goat cheese and peppery arugula add color and balance, while toasted walnuts add crunch. A mandoline is the best way to get thin, even slices from the roasted beets. Greek Salad with Avocado I like this salad with regular roasted cashews - I also lovee it with those super spicy, flavor-loaded Thai cashews from Trader Joe&#39;s! You can easily omit the Greek yogurt or mayo to keep this a vegan / dairy free salad! 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
