Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
