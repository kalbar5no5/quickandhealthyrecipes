If you prefer sweeter cream add 1 tablespoon of sugar when you whisk the cream."

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
