Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
