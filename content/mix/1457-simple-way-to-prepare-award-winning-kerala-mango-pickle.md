Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
