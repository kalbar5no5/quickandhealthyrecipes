Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
