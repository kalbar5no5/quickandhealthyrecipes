Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
