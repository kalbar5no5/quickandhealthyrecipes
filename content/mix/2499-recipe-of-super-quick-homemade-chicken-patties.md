Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
