Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
