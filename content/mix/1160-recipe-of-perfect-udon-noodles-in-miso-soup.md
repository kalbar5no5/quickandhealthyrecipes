Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
