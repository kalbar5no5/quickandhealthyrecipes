Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
