Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
