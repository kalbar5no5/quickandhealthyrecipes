How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
