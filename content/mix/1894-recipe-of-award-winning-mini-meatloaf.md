Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
