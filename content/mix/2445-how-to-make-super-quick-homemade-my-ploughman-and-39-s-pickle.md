Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
