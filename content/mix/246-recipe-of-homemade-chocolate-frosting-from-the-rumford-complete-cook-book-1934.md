Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
