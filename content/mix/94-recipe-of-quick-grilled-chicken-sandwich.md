Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
