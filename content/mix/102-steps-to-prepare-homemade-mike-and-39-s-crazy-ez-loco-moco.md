recipeinstructions:
- "Here&#39;s all you&#39;ll need!"
- "Regardless of the amount of rice you&#39;ll be needing - run cold water over your uncooked rice in a tight mesh strainer until water runs clear. Or, place in your pot and rinse until water runs clear. Allow rice to fully drain."
- "In a pot with a tight fitting lid and thick bottom - bring 2 cups water, 1 cup rice and 1 teaspoon oil or butter to a hard boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer rice for 15 minutes or until water dissipates. Don&#39;t peek and lift your lid! Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                         째 Authors Note: This is a minimal amount of rice and will usually make about 3 cups cooked rice. If you&#39;ll be needing more rice - double this or just follow manufactures directions. I&#39;ll also add a tablespoon dried onions in the rice pot if I have them on hand."
- "Season your beef patties with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder as you wish on both sides."
- "Place a small amount of oil in a frying pan with lid. Cook patties until done. Pierce the center. If you see any pink or red juices - fry longer but don&#39;t over cook."
- "Drain your patties on a clean paper towel."
- "In a clean frying pan - add fresh oil and fry eggs over easy to sunny side up with salt and pepper. You&#39;ll want your yolks runny to be authentic. Dab oil from fried eggs."
- "Mix your 2 McCormick Brown Gravy packets with 2 cups water [or, slightly less water if you want a thicker gravy] in a small pot while frying your eggs. Stir gravy constantly, bring to a boil and remove gravy from heat. You&#39;ll want to make your gravy last as a thick skin will form on the top of it rather quickly."
- "Pack your rice tightly in a ramekin with a spoon and gently flip over to release from the bowl. Or, you can simply pile rice on a plate un-molded. It&#39;s your choice. Pour gravy over the top of your rice, place patty on top of rice, cover with gravy and place egg on top. Garnish as you desire!                                                                               째 Garnishes pictured are dried chives and two types of fresh parsley. Serve with extra warm brown gravy on the side. Enjoy!"

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
