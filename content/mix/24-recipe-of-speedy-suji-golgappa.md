Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
