Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
