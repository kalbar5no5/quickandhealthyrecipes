recipeinstructions:
- "Even if the package says, &#34;no need to de-sand the clams,&#34; they are still alive and there are toxins inside so let&#39;s get them out."

- "Put the shijimi clams it. Cover with newspaper and let the shijimi rest for about 2 hours. If it&#39;s a warm day, it&#39;s better to put them in the fridge for this step."
- "In the meantime make the kombu dashi stock. Gently wipe the kombu with a tightly wrung out cloth and then put it in some water to soak."
- "After two hours... Look what came out! I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t eat all this..."
- "Take out the piece of kombu and then add the shijimi clams into the water!"
- "When you boil it, scum will rise, so skim it off."
- "Once you think the shijimi clams are starting to open, lower the heat to low and dissolve the miso. It&#39;s done!"
- "Don&#39;t let it boil after adding the miso."

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
