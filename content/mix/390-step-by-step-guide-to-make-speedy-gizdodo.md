Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
