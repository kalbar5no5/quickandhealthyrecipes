Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
