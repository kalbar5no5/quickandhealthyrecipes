Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
