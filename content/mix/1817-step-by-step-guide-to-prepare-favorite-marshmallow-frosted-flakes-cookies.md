Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
