Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
