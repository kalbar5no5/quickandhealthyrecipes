Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
