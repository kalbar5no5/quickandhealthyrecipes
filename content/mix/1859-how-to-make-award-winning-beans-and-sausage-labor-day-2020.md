Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
