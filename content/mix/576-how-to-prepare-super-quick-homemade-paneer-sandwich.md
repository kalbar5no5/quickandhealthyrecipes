Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
