Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
