How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
