Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
