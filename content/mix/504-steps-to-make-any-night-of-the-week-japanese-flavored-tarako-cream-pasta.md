Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
