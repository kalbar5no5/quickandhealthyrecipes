How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood.

The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
