Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
