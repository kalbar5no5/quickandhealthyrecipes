Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
