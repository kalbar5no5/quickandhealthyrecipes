Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
