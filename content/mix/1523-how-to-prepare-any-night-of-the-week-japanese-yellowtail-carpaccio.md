Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
