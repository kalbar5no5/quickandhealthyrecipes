Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
