Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
