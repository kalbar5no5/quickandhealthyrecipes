Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
