Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
