Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
