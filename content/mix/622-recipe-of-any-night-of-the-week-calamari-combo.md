Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
