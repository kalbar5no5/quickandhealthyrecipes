Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
