Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
