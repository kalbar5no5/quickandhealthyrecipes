Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
