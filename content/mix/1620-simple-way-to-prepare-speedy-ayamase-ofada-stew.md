Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
