Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
