Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
