Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
