Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
