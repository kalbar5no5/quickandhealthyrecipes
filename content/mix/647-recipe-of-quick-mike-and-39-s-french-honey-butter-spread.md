Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
