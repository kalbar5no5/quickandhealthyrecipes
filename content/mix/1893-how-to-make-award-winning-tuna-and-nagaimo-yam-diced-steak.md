Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
