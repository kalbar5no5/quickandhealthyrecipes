Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
