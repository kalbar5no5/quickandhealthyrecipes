Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
