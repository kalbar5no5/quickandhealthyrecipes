Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
