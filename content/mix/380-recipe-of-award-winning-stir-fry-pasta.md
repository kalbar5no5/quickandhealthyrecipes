Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
