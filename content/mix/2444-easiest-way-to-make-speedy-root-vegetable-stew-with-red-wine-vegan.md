Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
