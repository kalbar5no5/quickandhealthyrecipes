Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed.
