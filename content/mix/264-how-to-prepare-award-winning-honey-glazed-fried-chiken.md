Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
