Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
