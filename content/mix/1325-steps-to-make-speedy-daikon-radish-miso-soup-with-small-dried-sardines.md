Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
