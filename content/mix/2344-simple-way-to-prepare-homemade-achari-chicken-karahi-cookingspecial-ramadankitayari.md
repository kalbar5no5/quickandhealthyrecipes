Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
