Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
