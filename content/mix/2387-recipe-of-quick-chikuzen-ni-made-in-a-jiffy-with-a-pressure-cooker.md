Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
