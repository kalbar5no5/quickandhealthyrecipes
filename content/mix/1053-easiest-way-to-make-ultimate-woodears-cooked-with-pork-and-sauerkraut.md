Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
