How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
