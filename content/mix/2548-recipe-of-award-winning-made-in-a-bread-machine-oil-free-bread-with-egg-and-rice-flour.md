Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
