Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
