Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
