How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
