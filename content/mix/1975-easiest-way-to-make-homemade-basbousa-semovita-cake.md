Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!
