One interesting fact is that it was invented in South Africa by Wilson Rowntree but it is however now produced by Nestle and sold as a chocolate bar. We cannot imagine a braai, lunch or dinner where a Peppermint Crisp tart wouldn&#39;t be a hit. We love the beautiful colours of the layers in the tart, and the chocolate and caramel combination is to die for.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
