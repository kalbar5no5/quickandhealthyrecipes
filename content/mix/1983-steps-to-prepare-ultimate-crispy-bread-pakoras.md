Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
