Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
