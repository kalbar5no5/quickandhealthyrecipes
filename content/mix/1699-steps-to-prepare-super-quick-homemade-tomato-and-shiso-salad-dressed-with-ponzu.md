Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
