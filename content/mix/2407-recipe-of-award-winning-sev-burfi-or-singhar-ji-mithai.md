Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
