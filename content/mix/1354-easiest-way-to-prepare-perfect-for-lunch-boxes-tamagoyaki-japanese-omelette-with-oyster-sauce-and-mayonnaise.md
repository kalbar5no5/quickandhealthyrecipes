Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
