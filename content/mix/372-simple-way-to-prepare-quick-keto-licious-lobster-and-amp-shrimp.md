Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
