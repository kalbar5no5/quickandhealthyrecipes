Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
