Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
