My fave foods to stuff my face indulge in while watching any sport are nachos loaded with glorious cheese, salt and vinegar chips, and/or chicken wings. Since we&#39;re watching what we eat these days at Casa de Crews, my beloved nachos are out, as are the chips. Combine vinegar, salt and oil in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken wings in the bag with the marinade and toss to coat. Remove the wings from the air fryer and while still hot, sprinkle with garlic salt. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
