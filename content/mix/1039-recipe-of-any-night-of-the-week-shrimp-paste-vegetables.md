Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
