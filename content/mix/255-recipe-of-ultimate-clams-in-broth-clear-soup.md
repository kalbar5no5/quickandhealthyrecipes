Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
