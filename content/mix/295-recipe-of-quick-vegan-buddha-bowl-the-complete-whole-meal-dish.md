Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
