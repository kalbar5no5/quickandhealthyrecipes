Heat the oil in a large soup or stockpot. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic (if using), chopped celery, and sliced carrots. The only ingredients you need for a basic homemade vegetable soup are vegetables, water or vegetable broth, and a few spices. This simple template allows you to get creative and add more vegetables, potatoes or whole grains such as quinoa, barley, rice or even rolled oats to add texture and fiber. To make vegetable noodle soup, add your choice of noodles when you add the potatoes until fully cooked. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
