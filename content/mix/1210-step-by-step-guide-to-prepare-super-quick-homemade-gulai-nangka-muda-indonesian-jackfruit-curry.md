Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
