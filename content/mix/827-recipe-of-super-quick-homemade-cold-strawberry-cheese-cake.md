Cool it the way you would normally, first at room temperature and then in the fridge until set. Then wrap your homemade strawberry cheesecake (whole or in slices) first with plastic wrap and then with foil. Cheesecake came out perfect, I just used strawberry cake mix for strawberry cake layers. Followed the frosting recipe exactly but when I applied to cake it became very runny. I made it the day before so it was refrigerated overnight and removed from fridge right before I frosted cake. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
