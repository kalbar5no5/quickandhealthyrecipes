Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
