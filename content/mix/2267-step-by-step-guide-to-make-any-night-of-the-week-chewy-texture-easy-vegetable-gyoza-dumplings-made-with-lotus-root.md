How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
