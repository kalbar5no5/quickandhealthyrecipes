Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
