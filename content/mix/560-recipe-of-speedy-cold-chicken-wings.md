Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
