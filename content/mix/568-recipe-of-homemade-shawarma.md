Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
