Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
