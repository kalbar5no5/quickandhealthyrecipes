Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
