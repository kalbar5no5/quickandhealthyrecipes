Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
