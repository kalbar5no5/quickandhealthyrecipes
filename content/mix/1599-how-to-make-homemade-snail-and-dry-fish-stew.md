Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
