Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
