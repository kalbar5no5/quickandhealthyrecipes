Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
