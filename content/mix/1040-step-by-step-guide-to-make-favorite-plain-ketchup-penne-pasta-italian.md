Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
