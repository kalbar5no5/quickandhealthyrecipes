Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
