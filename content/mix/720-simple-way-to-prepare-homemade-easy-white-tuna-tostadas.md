Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
