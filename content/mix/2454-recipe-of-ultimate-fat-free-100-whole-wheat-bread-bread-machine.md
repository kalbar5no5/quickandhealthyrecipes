Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
