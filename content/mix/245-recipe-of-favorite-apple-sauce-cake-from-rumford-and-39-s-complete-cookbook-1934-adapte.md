Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
