Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
