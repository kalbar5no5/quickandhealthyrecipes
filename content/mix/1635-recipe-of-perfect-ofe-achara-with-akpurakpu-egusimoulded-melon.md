Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
