Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
