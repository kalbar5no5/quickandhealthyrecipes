Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
