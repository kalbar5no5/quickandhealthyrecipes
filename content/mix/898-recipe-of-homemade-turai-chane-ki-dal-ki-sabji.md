Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
