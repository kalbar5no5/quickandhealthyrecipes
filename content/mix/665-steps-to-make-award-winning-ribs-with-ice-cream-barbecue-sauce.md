Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
