Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
