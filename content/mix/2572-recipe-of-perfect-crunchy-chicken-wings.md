Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
