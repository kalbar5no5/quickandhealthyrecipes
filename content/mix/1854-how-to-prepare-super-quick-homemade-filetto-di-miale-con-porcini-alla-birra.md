Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
