Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
