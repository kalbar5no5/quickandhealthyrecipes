Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
