Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
