Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
