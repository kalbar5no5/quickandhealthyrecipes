How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body.
