Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
