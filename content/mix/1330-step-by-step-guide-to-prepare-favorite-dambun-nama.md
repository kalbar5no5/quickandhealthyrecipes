How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
