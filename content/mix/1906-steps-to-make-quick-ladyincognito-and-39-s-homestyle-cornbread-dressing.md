Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
