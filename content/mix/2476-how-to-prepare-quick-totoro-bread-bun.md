Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
