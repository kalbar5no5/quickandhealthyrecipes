Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
