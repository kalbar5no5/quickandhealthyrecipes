How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
