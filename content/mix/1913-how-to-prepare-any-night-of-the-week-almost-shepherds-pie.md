Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
