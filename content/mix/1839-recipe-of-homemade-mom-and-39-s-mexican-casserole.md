Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
