Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
