Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
