I liked the mix of sweet, sharp and savory that all three bring to the table, but feel. Make garlic compound butter: In a small bowl, mix softened butter with garlic, salt, and parsley until well combined. Spread the garlic mixture on the other half of the bread, and put the halves together. I simplify the whole recipe by stirring the garlic powder, parsley, and parmesan into softened butter to make a thick paste, spread the mixture onto the bread slices, and sprinkling a bit of paprika in the center of each piece.then bake! Garlic bread is toasted bread—usually French bread or baguette—topped with either butter or olive oil, garlic, herbs, and sometimes cheese. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
