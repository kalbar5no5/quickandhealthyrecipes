Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
