How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
