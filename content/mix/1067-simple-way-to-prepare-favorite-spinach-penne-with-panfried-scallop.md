Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
