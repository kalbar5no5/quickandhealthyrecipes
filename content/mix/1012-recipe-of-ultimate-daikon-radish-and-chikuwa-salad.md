Shred the crabsticks, and drain the corn very well. Daikon is mild flavored, very large, white Japanese radish, and it&#39;s often used as garnishing for sashimi or grated and served with Agedashi Tofu or Tempura. The Daikon radish salad is a very healthy recipe as the root is enjoyed raw without damaging the nutritious values. It&#39;s also super easy to prepare the daikon salad from scratch.

##### The ingredients needed to make Daikon Radish and Chikuwa Salad:

1. Get 6 cm piece Daikon radish
1. Make ready 2 Chikuwa
1. Make ready 1 Bonito flakes

Adjust to taste, adding additional salt, sugar or vinegar, if needed. The premise of Japanese cooking is to highlight the natural and fresh flavors of foods. Often, a typical Japanese meal will include several small &#34;okazu&#34; main and side dishes, and it would seem completely natural to incorporate two different types of Japanese salads served in very small portions. For example, this arugula and kaiware (daikon radish sprouts) salad, along with a small.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
