Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
