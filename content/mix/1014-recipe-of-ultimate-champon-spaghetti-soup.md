How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
