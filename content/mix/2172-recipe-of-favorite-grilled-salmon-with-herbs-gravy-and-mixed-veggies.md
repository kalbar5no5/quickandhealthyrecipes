Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
