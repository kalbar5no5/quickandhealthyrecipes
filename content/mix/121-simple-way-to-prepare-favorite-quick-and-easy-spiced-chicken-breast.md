Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
