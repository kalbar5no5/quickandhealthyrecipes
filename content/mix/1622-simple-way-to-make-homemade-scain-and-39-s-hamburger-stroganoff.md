Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
