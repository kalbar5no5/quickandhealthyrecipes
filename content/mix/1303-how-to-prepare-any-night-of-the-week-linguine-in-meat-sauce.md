Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
