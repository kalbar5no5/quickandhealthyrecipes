##### The ingredients needed to make Japanese paella:

1. Make ready 2 Pacific sauries
1. Take 2 cup rice
1. Make ready 5-7 dried shiitake mushroom
1. Get 1-2 carrot
1. Get 1 head lotus root
1. Get 1 head ginger

1. Prepare  @ 3 tbs soy sause

Cut off the head and tail of the pacific sauries, take away the guts and wash it clean. Add the shrimps and short-neck clams and bring to a boil on medium heat. Paella is a traditional dish from Spain, a very tasty rice dish with seafood. But in Japan, mussel and head-on shrimp are very expensive, so I used Japanese ingredients, such as shimeji mushrooms, clams (in season now), and head-off shrimps.

Paella is a traditional dish from Spain, a very tasty rice dish with seafood. But in Japan, mussel and head-on shrimp are very expensive, so I used Japanese ingredients, such as shimeji mushrooms, clams (in season now), and head-off shrimps. Stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, and rice. Stir in saffron threads, bay leaf, parsley, chicken stock, and lemon zest. Don&#39;t Get Hung Up on Specific Ingredients. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
