A quick breakfast doesn&#39;t have to come in the form of a muffin or fast food breakfast sandwich to count as a healthy breakfast option. Trail mixes, which often feature nuts, fruit, and granola, are a great option for busy mornings. It&#39;s easy to just reach for a store-bought bar or frozen breakfast, but a satisfying home-cooked breakfast can be on the table in mere minutes with the help of one superstar ingredient: eggs. Easy breakfast eggs are tasty, versatile, and packed with protein to keep you feeling full. We like quick and simple morning meals during the week, and these wraps are great when prepared ahead of time. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
