Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
