Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
