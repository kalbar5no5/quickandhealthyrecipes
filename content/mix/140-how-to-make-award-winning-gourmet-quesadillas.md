Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
