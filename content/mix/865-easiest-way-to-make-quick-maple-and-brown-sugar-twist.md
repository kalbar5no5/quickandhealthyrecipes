Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
