- "1/2 cup (113 gr) unsalted butter"
- "1/2 cup (100 gr) granulated white sugar"
- "3 large eggs"

- "2 cups all purpose flour 256 gr"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "125 ml (1 container) strawberry yoghurt"
- "1/2 cup (120 ml) toasted almond"
- "170 ml strawberry jam"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven into 350°F or 180°C"
- "When preheating oven, you could toast your almond in it about 5-8 minutes or until you could smell the fragrance from the outside of your oven. Chopped them coarsely."
- "Sift together all the dry ingredients such as all purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla essence, cinnamon powder, and salt. Set aside."
- "In the other bowl cream together butter and sugar until fluffy and the color turned pale."
- "Add the eggs one at a time, whisk them until well mixed."
- "Add the dry ingredients by dividing them into 1/3 and alternate them with the yoghurt when pouring them inside the wet batter."

- "Add the strawberry jam and the toasted chopped almond into the batter, fold them gently until all combined."
- "Pour the batter inside the container that have already been greased by butter and dusted with flour."
- "Bake about 40-45 minutes or until completely done. If you use a smaller oven or toaster you should pay attention on the temperature. I&#39;ve burnt mine (the top of the bread) when baked it with 350°F or 180°C,. Perhaps the oven that I used was small. If you have the same issue, bake them 350°F /180°C for the first 5 minutes and turn the heat lower into 302°F / 150°C until 325 °F / 160°C afterward."
- "Try to check the bread after 35 minutes with the tooth pick or bamboo skewer. If it comes out clean it means your bread is done. But if it comes out with the wet batter it means you should continue the baking process about 5-10 more minutes."

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
