Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
