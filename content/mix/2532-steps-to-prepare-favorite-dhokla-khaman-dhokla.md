Khaman dhokla or khaman as its called is a savory steamed cake made from gram flour (besan).

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
