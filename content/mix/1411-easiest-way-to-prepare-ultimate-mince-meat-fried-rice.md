Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
