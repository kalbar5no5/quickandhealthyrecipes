Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
