Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
