Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
