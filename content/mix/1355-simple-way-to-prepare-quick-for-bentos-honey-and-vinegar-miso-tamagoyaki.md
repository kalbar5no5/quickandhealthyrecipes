Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
