Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood.

The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine.
