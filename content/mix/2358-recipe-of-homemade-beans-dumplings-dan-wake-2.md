Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
