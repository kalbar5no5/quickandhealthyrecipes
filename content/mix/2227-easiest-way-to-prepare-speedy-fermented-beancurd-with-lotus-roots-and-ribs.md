Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
