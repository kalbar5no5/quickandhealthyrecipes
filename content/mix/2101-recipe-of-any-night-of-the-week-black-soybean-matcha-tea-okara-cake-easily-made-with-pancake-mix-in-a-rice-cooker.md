Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
