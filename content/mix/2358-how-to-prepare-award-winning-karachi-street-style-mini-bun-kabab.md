Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
