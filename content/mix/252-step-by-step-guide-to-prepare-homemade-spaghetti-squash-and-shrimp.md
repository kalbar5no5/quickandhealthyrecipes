Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
