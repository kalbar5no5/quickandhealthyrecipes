How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
