Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
