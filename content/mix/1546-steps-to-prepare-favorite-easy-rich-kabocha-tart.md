Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
