Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
