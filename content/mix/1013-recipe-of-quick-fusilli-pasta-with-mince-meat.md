Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
