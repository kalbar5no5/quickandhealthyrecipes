How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
