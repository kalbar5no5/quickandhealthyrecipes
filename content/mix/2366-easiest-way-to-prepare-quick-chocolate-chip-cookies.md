Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
