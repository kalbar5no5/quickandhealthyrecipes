Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
