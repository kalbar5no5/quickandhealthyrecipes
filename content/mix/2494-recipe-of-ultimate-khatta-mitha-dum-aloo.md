Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
