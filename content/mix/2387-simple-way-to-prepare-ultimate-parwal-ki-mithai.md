Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
