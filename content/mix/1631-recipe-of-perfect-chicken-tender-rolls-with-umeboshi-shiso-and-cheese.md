Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
