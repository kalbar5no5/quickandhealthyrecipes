Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
