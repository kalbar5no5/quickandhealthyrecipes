Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
