A Tex Mex burger jacks up the flavors by mixing ground meat with jalapenos, taco sauce, refried beans, and a garlic-onion butter. A sriracha bacon burger packs the heat in both the beef mixture as well as the sauce. Or try a blue cheese beer burger a sweet and spicy mayo; this way, those who don&#39;t want any heat can skip the spread. Great recipe for Spicy jalapeño burger.

I like a really spicy chicken burger, so I not only add minced jalapeño to the chicken patty, but also to the smashed avocado. If you like things on the more mild side, you could leave out the jalapeño all together or take out the stems and seeds. The exact recipe below yields medium spicy turkey burgers. I don&#39;t like super spicy foods, but loved these.

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!
