This is a basic club sandwich you&#39;ll find on the menus of most restaurants in Canada with the exception it doesn&#39;t include cheese whether it be processed or swiss. I always add salt and pepper in moderation to the tomatoes. I also find Miracle Whip rather than mayonnaise adds a little more pizzazz. Spread mayonnaise on third piece of toast and place on the stack mayo side down.

I also find Miracle Whip rather than mayonnaise adds a little more pizzazz. Spread mayonnaise on third piece of toast and place on the stack mayo side down. Slice the sandwich in quarters diagonally. Skewers or long toothpicks may be used to hold all the layers together. Club sandwiches are usually made from plain white sandwich bread, toasted until it gets crisp. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
