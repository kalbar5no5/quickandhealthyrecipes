Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
