In a large pot add the turkey legs and cover with water. Add a lid, then Place on stove top and heat over medium high heat and bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and continue to cook till legs are tender.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
