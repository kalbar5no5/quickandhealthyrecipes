Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
