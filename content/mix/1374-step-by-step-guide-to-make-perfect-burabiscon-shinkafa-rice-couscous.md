Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
