Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
