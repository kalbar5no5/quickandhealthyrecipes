Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
