Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
