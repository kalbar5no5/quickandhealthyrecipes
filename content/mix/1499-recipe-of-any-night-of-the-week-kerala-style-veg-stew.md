Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
