Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
