Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
