Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
