Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
