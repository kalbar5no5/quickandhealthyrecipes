Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
