Kinpira renkon is braised lotus root and is part of the Japanese culinary tradition of izakaya, or small plates. Kinpira is a Japanese cooking style in which sliced vegetables are stir-fried and seasoned with sugar and soy sauce. Saute the lotus root slices for a couple of minutes, or until the edges of the lotus root start to become translucent. A quick saute of crunchy lotus root slices and chewy gingko nuts.

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
