recipeingredient:
- "2/3 pound smoked bacon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a skillet. This is optional you can spray nonstick spray or use a nonstick pan. Or a well seasoned cast iron skillet."
- "Add the bacon and start rendering the fat of the bacon. If it starts to smoke a bit turn down the heat or add more bacon. This will cool the pan and the drippings."
- "Turn often the bacon will have a tendency to stick no matter what pan or skillet you have. Just slide a meat fork or spatula under it to turn."
- "When the last of the bacon is done immediately turn off the heat have the jar ready. Put some type of paper products under the jar to insulate under it. Especially if you have stone countertops because hot and cold may cause the soon to be hot jar to explode, due to quickly changing temperatures. This is true with anything. Also the paper products will catch any spillage of bacon drippings when pouring."
- "Get a jar that has a lid and is sterile. Add the bacon drippings to it the jar will be hot for a while. Make sure you have a food grade jar that can or has had food in it."
- "Store and use as needed. I hope you enjoy!"

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
