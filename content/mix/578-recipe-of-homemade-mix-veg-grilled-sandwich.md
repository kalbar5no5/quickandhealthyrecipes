Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
