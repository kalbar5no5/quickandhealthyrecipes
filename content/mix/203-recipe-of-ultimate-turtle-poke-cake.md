Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
