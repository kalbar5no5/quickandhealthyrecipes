Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
