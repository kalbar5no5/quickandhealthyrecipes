Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
