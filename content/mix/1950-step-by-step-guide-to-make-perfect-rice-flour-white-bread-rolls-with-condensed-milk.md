Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
