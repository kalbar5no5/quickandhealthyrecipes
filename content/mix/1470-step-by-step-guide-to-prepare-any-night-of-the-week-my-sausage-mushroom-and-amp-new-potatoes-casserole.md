How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
