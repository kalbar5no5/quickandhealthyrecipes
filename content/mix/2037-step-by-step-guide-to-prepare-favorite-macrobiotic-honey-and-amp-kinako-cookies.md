Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
