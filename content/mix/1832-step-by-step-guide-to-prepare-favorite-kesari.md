Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
