Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
