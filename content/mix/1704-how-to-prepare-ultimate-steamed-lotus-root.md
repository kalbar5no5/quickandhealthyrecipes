How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
