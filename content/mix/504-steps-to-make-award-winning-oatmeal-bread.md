Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
