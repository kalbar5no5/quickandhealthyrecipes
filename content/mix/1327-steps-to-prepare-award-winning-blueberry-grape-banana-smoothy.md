Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
