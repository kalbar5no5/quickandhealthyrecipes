Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
