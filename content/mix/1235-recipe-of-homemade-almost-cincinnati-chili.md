Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
