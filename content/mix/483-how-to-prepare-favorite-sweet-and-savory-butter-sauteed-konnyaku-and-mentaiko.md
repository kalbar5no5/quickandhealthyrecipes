Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
