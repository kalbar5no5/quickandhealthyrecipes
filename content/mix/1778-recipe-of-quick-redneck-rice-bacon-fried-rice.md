Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
