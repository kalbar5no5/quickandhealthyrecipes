Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood.

These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down!
