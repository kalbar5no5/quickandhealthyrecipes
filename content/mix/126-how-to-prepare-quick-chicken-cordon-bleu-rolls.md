Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
