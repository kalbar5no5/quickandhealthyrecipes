Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
