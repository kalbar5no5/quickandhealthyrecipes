How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
