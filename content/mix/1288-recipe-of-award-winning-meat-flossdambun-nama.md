Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
