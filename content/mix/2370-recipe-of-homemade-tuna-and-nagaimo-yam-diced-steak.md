Using two forks, flake the tuna into bite size chunks. In a large bowl, combine the cooked noodles, soup, milk, peas and tuna. I finally had the chance to make the sauteed yams today. I made BBQ T-bone steak, sauteed yams, steamed baby French carrots, easy garden salad, and poaches pears in red wine. If they&#39;re not marinated, brush the tuna steaks with melted butter or olive oil, and season as desired. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
