Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
