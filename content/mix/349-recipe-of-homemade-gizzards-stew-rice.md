Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
