Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
