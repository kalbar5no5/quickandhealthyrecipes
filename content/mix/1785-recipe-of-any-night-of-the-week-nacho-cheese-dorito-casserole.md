Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
