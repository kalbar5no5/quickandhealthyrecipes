Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
