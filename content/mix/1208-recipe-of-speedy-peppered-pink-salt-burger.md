But does it really matter when you season the meat? Can you do it ahead of time, or should you wait until the very. Season one side of the patty with salt and pepper right before you place it on the grill, seasoned side down. It seems I had heard at some point that putting salt on the burger before grilling will cause the meat to dry out, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s right or not. There are some non-adventurous eaters in the crowd today, and it is definitely a crowd today, so we are just using salt and pepper on all the burgers to keep everybody happy. 

Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
