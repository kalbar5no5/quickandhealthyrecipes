Add chopped walnuts reserving a tbsp alone. DIRECTIONS Combine the prunes, sugar, lemon rind and lemon juice in a small pt. Cook, stirring over low heat until thick. The relationship of soil dryness to stem water potential is straightforward: as the soil becomes dryer, stem water potential will become more negative. Place prunes, honey, peanut butter and cocoa powder into the food processor and pulse until mixture is finely chopped and it comes together nicely. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
