Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
