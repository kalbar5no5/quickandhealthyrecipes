Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
