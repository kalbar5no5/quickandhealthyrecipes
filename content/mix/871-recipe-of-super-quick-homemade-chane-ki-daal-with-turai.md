Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
