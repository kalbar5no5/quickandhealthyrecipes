In addition to kecap manis, the country&#39;s ubiquitous sweet soy sauce, terasi (Indonesian shrimp paste) is what sets nasi goreng apart from other fried-rice variations you&#39;ll see in other countries. Terasi is an umami bomb that pervades both your kitchen and your senses. Jane Grigson&#39;s take on nasi goreng uses strips of omelette rather than the more common fried egg. Kecap manis, a sweet, thick soy sauce, is, as Tanumihardja observes, a must, though you could.

Jane Grigson&#39;s take on nasi goreng uses strips of omelette rather than the more common fried egg. Kecap manis, a sweet, thick soy sauce, is, as Tanumihardja observes, a must, though you could. This dish can be enjoyed by itself or as the basis of a larger meal, for example with a rijsttafel. Adapted from James Oseland&#39;s Cradle of Flavor coobook—a bible for authentic Indonesian and Malaysian/Singapore cuisines—this nasi goreng is the Javanese version of fried rice. As Jim indicated in his cookbook, a truly authentic nasi goreng Indonesia is plain and simple, consisting of leftover rice stir-fried with a flavoring paste. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
