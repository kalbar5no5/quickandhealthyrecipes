Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins.

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest.
