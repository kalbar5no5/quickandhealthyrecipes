Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk.

This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood.

Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!
