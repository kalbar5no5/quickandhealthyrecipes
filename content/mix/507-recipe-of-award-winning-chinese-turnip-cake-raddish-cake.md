Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
