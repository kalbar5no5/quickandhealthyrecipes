recipeingredient:
- " pretzel dough"
- "1 packages quick rise dry yeast"
- "1 cup warm water"
- "2 1/2 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 tbsp white sugar"
- "1/2 tsp table salt"
- " water bath"
- "8 cup boiling water"
- "1/4 cup baking soda"
- "1 tbsp brown sugar"
- " egg wash"
- "1 large egg"
- "2 tbsp warm water"
- " topping options"
- "1 kosher salt"
- "1 garlic powder"
- "1 cinnamon sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a small mixing bowl, add yeast to 1 cup of warm water. Let sit for a moment or two, then stir to dissolve."
- "Add sugar, salt, and flour to yeast and water mixture. Stir to combine then as dough starts to come together, knead by hand for about 5-7 minutes."
- "Once dough becomes like elastic and only slightly sticky (I added a few pinches of extra flour as kneading) transfer to a larger bowl that has been rubbed down lightly with oil. Cover and let rise until dough has doubled in size, approximately 1 hour."
- "After dough has risen, dump it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 8 equal portions. Hand roll each section into a rope about 1 &amp; 1/2 feet long. Now try your best to make that classic pretzel shape! It&#39;s best to lay it down, start with a U, and bring the ends in wrapping them around each other in the middle. Once you have all your pretzels laid out, cover them and let them puff up for about 20 minutes."
- "Prepare your water bath. You&#39;ll need a wide, deep pot. Bring 8 cups of water to a rolling boil. Add brown sugar and baking soda. When you add the baking soda it will foam and nearly double in size. Reduce to simmer."
- "Add pretzels to your water bath one at a time to avoid crowding. You&#39;ll probably only be able to fit 2 or 3 in at a time. Simmer each side for 30 seconds. Remove from pot, set aside on a greased baking sheet, and repeat with the rest!"
- "Now once your pretzels are all boiled, make your egg wash. Brush each pretzel liberally. While you begin this process, preheat your oven to 450째F."
- "Top your pretzels however you wish. I stuck with kosher salt, while my fiance made a few with cinnamon sugar and a few with garlic and black pepper."
- "Bake for 12 minutes at 450째F or until your desired level of golden brown beauty has been achieved!"

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
