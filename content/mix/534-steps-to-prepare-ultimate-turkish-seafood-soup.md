This soup was her gift and soon the locals named the soup after her so the soup became known as Ezo Gelin soup, which is now extended all over Turkey. For my small family, a hearty soup can be a main course itself with some nice crusty bread next to it. I made this lovely Turkish vegetable soup with orzo pasta today and it went down very well. Simple yet delicious, Turkish lentil soup, or &#34;Mercimek Corbasi&#34; is a blended puree of lentils and spices.

I made this lovely Turkish vegetable soup with orzo pasta today and it went down very well. Simple yet delicious, Turkish lentil soup, or &#34;Mercimek Corbasi&#34; is a blended puree of lentils and spices. This puree is then garnished with cilantro and a squeezed lemon slice for added zing and flavour. Served with hot pitas on the side, this dish is satisfying and filling while remaining inexpensive. Known as the soup of Ezo the bride, this flavour has a rather sad love story attached to its humble roots. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
