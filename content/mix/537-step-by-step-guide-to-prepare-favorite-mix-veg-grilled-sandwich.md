Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
