Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
