Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
