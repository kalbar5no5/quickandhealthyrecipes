Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
