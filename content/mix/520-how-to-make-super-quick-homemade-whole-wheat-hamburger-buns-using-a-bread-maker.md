Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
