Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
