Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
