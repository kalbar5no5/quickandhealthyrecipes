Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
