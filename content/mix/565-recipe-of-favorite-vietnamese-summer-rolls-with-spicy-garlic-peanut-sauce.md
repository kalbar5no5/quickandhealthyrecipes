Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
