Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
