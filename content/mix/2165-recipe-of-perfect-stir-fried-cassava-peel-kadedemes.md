Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!
