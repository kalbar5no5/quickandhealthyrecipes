##### Steps to make Roast tomato soup with pesto and grilled cheese toasties:

1. In blender: tomatoes, stock, paprika, chili, basil. Blend to smooth. Gently reheat immediately (or can be frozen for later)
1. Pesto generously spread on one side of bread. Grate over cheese. Top with bread. Butter both outsides and put in sandwich toaster, or in dry frypan with weighted plate on top. About 2 mins per side. Slice in to soldiers and dunk in soup.

Place the tomatoes, bell peppers and jalapeno on the baking sheet sliced-side down, covering the garlic cloves and thyme as you go along. Pour over the onions, drizzle the top of everything with. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
