Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
