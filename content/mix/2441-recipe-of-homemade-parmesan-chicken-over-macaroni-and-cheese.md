This recipe is great served with roasted potatoes. Add onion to pasta and stir to combine. In a medium heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, melt butter. Instead of butter, I used olive oil, and sautÃ©ed a medium sized onion in the skillet prior to adding the chicken. The recipe calls for chicken strips, but I prefer bite-size chunks. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
