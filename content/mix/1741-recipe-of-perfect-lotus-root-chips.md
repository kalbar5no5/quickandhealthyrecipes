Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood.

These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body.
