It&#39;s not as well marbled as a ribeye, but that&#39;s actually a good thing, as it needs less time. 

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
