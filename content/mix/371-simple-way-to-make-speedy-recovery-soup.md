How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
