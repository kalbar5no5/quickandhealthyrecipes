- "Allow roast to simmer for at least 2 1/2 hours minimum - stove top - with a tight fitting lid. I allow mine to go for 4 hours. Carefully flip her over occasionally for even cooking and moisture retention. You&#39;ll know she&#39;s done when you can easily shred her apart with two forks. Or, the pork bone pulls out with ease."

- "Place shredded meat mixture back into your pot and add your DELICIOUS Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s BBQ Sauce amounts to your liking and mix. Moist or dry, it&#39;s all up to you! But, we always go wet! It&#39;s unanimous! We even re-coat our sandwiches with it upon serving. Reheat shredded pork."
- "Generously pile your sweet pulled pork on to your bread [you&#39;ll definitely want a sturdy bread] of choice and add your chilled purple onions. Also, drizzle your Tiger Sauce and additional SBR&#39;s on your sandwiches to taste. Top sandwiches with chilled Cole Slaw and dill pickles if desired. Or, serve pickle halves to the side. You&#39;ll need them to cut the sweetness of the SBR&#39;s. The Clausens Dill Pickle brand is absolutely the best one out there! Trust me. I know my pickles! ;0) You&#39;ll find them in your refrigerated section of your local market."
- "Enjoy your Summer and your sandwiches!"

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
