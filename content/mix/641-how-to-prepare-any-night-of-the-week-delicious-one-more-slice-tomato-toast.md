This recipe reminded me of savory French toast and would be delicious served with fried eggs or bacon. Try making it instead of standard French toast for an unexpected change-up.. but swapping out the dairy for tomato soup for a more savory result. Thinly slice the red onion, then rinse the slices several times under cold water. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
