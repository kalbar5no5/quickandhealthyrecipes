Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
