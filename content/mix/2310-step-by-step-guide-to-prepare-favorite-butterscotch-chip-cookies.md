Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
