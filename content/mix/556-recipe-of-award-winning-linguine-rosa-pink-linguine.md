Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
