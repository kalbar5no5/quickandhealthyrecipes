Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
