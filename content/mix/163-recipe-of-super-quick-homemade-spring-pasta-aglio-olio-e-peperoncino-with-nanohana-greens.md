Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
