Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
