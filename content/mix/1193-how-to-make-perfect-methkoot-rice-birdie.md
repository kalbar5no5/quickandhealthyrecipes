Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
