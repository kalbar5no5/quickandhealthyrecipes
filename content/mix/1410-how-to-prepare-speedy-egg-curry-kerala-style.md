Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
