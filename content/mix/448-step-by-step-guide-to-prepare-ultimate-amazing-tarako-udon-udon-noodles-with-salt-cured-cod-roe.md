Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
