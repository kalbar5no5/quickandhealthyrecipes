Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
