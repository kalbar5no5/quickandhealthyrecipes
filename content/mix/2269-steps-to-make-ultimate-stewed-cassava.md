How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
