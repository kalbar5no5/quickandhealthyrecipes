Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
