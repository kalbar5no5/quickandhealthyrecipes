Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
