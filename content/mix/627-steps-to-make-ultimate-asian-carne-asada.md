Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
