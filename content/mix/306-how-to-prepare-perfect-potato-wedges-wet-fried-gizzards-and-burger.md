Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
