How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
