How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
