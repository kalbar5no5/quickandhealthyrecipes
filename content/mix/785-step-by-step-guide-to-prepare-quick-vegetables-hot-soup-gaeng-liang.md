How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
