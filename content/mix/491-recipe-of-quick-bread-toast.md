Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
