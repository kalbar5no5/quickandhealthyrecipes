Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
