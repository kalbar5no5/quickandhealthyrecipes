Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
