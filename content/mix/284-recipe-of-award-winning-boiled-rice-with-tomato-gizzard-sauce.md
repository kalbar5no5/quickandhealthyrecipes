Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
