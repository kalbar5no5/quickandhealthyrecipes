Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
