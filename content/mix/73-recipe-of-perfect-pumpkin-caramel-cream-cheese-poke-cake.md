Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
