Serve with buttered egg noodles or mashed potatoes. Hearty beef stew is definitely a down to earth classic but there are steps you can take to elevate it. This will allow you to develop layers of flavor and help to provide a deep, rich broth that&#39;s so essential to a dish like this one. As with any soup or stew, the first step is to gather your ingredients along with a knife and a cutting board. This beef stew uses baby red potatoes and baby carrots, eliminating some of the peeling and chopping usually needed when using traditional baking potatoes and large carrots. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
