Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
