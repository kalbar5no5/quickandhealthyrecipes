Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
