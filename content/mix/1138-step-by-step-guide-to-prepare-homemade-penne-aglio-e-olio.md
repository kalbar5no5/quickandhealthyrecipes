Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
