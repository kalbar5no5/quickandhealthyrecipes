recipeingredient:
- "4 Egg yolks"
- "30 grams Sugar"
- "40 grams Vegetable oil"
- "20 grams Refined green tea"
- "65 grams Cake flour"
- "1 tsp Baking powder"
- "20 grams Amanatto"
- "4 Egg whites"
- "30 grams Sugar"
- "1/4 tsp Lemon juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Grind the tea leaves with a mortar and pestle."
- "Run through a sifter."
- "Heat 60 ml of water in a small pot. Turn off the heat just before it begins to boil and add the tea powder."
- "Strain through a tea strainer and set aside 40 ml of the tea."
- "Separate the egg yolks from the whites. Chill the egg whites in the refrigerator for 15~20 minutes. If you do this, you can make a strong meringue."
- "Beat the egg yolks with a whisk. Add the sugar and mix well. Add the liquid tea and vegetable oil and mix well."
- "Add the sifted tea powder and mix well."
- "Sift together the dry ingredients and add to the bowl. Use a whisk to quickly mix it together until no longer powdery."
- "Add the ama-natto and mix well."
- "Add the chilled egg whites, 1/3 of the sugar, and lemon juice and mix with an electric mixer until it begins to form soft peaks and the mixture does not come out when the bowl is flipped over."
- "Why add the lemon juice to the egg whites? This helps to get the egg whites to foam up high. The egg whites are alkaline, so by adjusting the pH with lemon juice, it helps it foam up higher."
- "Add 1/3 of the thickened meringue to the egg yolk batter and use a whisk to quickly mix it together until smooth."
- "Return this mixture to the remaining meringue and gently mix with a rubber spatula by scooping it up from the bottom while turning the bowl. Do this until you can no longer see the meringue."
- "The completed batter is fluffy. It&#39;s perfect if it doesn&#39;t easily slide off the spatula when you lift it."
- "Transfer the batter to the cake pan. Do not oil the pan."
- "Stir with cooking chopsticks while turning to break up air holes in the batter."
- "Bake in an oven preheated to 180°C for 40-45 minutes."
- "Once baked, flip upside down over a glass bottle to cool."
- "Remove from the pan and enjoy!"
- "I used this tea."
- "It&#39;s so delicious! It&#39;s fluffy and melts in your mouth. It&#39;s even better than what they serve in cafes!"

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
