While the veggie are simmering, prepare the pasta according to directions on package. (cooking to al dente.) Add both types of beans to the soup. Serve the soup into individual bowls. Pasta e fagioli translates to &#34;pasta and beans.&#34; Pasta and beans may not sound terribly enticing (unless you&#39;re me), but I assure you that this Italian stew is truly irresistible. Lots of aromatics, crushed tomatoes, fresh parsley and Tuscan kale turn pasta and beans into a hearty meal-in-a-bowl situation.

I make a more tasty and complex pasta fagioli but this one was pretty good for the time it took. I also used a big can of cannelli beans. overall pretty tasty and really easy to make! In a saucepan, saute onion and garlic in butter and oil. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
