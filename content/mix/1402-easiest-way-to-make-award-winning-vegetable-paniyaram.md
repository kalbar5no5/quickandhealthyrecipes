Here I have made it with a blend of rice with chana dal (Bengal gram) and urad dal (skinned and split black gram). Kuzhi Paniyaram is basically a popular South Indian breakfast dish. It is generally made using the left over Idly Dosa batter in a cast iron paniyaram pan. But my mom never made them using left over idly batter , she always made the batter for Paniyaram from scratch and it had chana dal along with rice. Take paniyaram batter in a bowl, all the ingredients &amp; mix well. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
