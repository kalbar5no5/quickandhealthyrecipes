Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
