Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
