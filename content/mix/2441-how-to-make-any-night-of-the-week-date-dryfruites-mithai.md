Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
