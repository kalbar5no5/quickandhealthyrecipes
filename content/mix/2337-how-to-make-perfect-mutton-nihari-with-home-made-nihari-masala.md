Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
