Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
