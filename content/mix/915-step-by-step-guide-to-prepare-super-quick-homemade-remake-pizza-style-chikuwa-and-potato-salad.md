##### Steps to make Remake Pizza-style Chikuwa and Potato Salad:

1. Open up the chikuwa sticks with scissors.
1. Pack the chikuwa with potato salad. Make sure to season the potato salad well with mayonnaise.
1. Top with melting cheese and cook in a oven for 4-5 minutes.


This is now my new potato salad version. The green peas also made it look prettier and it also helped make the entire salad taste better. Meanwhile make the vinaigrette (watch How To Make Dressings here). Adding carrots in with the potatoes as they boil not only adds a splash of color, they contribute a balancing sweetness to the savory and tart potato salad. If you like your potato salad even sweeter, try adding some chopped apples at the end. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
