Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
