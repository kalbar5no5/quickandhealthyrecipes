Place bottom halves of slider buns on a large baking sheet and top with roast beef, provolone cheese, caramelized onions, and slider bun tops. In a small bowl, whisk together water, and the soup and gravy mixes. Huge plug here for fresh cut deli meat since that is one of the biggest components in these sliders. ALSO since it&#39;s getting baked, you want to aim for a rare cut of roast beef so it will be still tender, moist, and flavorful after being cooked (and reach about medium+). Lay on roast beef or ham, then one or two slices of cheese (I cut them to fit the small buns.) If you&#39;re using Cheez Whiz, spread a layer on the top bun. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
