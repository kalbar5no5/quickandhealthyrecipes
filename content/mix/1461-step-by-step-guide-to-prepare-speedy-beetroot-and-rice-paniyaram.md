How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
