Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
