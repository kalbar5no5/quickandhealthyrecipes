Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
