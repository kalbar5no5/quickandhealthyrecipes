Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
