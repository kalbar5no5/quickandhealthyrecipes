Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
