Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
