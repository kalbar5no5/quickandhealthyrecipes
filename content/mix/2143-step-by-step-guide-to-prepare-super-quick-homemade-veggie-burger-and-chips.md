Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
