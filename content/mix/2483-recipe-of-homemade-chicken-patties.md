Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
