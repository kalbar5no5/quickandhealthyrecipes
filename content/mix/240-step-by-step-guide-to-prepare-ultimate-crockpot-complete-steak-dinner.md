Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
