Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
