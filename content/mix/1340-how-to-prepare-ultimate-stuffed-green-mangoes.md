It&#39;s hard to imagine that a green bell pepper could adequately substitute for a mango, but that&#39;s the story I found in more than one source, and supposedly when English cookbooks were printed in America, they spread the concept of calling green peppers &#34;stuffed mangoes.&#34; Packaging was excellent but green mangoes were bland and flat in taste. Verified Purchase. &#34;What is a mango?&#34; was asked of Mr. Faulkner, of the Faulkner-Webb Company, which makes a specialty of pickling mangoes. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
