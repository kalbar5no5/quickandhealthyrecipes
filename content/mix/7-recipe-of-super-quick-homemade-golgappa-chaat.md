Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
