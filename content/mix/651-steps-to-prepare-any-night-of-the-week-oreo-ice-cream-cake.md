Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
