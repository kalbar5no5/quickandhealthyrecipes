Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
