Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
