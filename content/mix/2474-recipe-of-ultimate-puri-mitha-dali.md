Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
