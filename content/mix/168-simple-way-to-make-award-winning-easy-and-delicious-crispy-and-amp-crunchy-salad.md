Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
