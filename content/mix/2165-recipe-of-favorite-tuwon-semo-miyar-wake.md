Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
