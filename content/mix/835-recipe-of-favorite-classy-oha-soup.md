Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
