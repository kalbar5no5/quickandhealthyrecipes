How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
