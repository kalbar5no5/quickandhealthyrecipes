How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
