Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
