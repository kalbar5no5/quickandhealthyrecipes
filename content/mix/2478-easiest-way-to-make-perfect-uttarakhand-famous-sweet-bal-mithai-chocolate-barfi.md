Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
