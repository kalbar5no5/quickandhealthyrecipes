Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
