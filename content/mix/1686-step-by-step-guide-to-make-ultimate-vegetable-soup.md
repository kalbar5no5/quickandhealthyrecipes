Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
