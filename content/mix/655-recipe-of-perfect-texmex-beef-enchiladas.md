Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
