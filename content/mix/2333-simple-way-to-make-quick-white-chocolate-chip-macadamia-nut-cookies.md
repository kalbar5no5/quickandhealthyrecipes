Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
