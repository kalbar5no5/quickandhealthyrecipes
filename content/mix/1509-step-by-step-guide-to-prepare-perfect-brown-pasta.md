Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
