Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
