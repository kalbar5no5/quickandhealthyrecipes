Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
