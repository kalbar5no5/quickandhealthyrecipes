How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
