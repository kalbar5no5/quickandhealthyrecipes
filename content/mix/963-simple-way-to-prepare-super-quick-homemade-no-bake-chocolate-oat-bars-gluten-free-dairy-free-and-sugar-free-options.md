Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
