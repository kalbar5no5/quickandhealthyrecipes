Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
