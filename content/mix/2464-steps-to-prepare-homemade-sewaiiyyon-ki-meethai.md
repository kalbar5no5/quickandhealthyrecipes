Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
