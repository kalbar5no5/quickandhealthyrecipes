Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
