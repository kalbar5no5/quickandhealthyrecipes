Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
