Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
