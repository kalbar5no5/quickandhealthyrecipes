Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
