Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
