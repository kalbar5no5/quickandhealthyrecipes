Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
