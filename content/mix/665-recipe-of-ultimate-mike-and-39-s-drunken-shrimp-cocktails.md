Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
