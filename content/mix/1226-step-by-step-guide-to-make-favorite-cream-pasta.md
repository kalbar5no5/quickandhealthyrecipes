Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
