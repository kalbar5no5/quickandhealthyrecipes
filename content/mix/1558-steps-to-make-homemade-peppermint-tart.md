One interesting fact is that it was invented in South Africa by Wilson Rowntree but it is however now produced by Nestle and sold as a chocolate bar. We cannot imagine a braai, lunch or dinner where a Peppermint Crisp tart wouldn&#39;t be a hit. We love the beautiful colours of the layers in the tart, and the chocolate and caramel combination is to die for.

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
