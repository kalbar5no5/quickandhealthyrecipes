Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
