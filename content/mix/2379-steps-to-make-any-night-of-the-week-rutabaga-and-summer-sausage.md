Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
