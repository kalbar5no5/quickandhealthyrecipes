Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
