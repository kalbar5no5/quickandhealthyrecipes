Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
