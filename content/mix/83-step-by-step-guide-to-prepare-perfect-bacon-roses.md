Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
