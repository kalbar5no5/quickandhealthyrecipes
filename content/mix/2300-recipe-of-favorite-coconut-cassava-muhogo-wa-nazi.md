Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
