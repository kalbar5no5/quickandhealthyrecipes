Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
