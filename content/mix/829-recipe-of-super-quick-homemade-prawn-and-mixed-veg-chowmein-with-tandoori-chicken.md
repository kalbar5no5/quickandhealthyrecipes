Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
