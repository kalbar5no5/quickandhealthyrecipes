Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
