Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
