Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
