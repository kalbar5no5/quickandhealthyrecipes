Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
