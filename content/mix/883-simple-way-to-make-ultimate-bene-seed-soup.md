Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
