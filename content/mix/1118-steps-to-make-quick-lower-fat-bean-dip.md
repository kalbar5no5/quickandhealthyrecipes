Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
