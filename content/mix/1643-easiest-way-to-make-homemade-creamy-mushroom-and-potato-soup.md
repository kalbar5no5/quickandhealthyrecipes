Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
