Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
