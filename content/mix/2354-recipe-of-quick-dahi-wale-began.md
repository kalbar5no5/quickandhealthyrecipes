Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins.

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest.
