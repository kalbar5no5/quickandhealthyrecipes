Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
