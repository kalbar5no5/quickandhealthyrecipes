- "1 Kabocha squash"
- "1 Lotus root"
- "1 Carrot"
- "1 Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the carrot and lotus root and slice them with a mandoline. The kabocha squash is quite hard, so be careful not to injure yourself when preparing it."
- "Soak the lotus root slices in water for a while to prevent them from changing colour. While the lotus root is soaking, start heating the rest of the vegetables up in the microwave."
- "If you slice the carrot into strips rather than circles it&#39;ll be harder to burn them."
- "Pat the vegetables dry and arrange them on a large plate without them overlapping. If you want to season the vegetables with salt, do it now!"
- "Then put the plate in the microwave and heat the vegetables for 1-2 minutes. Then turn the vegetables over and cook them for another 1-2 minutes (this will help the vegetables to cook faster and the end product will be prettier).  Be careful not to burn yourself!"
- "Since these vegetables contain less moisture than potatoes or sweet potatoes, they will cook quicker. They&#39;re easy to burn though so please be careful."
- "When the moisture has all evaporated and the vegetable slices are dry and crispy, they&#39;re ready to eat."

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
