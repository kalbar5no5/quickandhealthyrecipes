Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
