Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
