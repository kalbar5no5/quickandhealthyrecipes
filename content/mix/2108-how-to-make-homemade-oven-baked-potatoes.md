Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
