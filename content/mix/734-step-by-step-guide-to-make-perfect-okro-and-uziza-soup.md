Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
