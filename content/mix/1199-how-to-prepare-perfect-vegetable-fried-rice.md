Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
