Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
