Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
