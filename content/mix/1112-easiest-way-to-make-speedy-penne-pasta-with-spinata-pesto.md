Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
