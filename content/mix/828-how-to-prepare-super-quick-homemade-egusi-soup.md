Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
