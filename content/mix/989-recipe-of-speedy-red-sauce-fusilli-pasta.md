Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
