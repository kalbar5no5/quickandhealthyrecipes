When New York City chef Chef Haruo Shibata wouldn&#39;t give us his secret recipe for this daikon salad, we started experimenting. We found we liked a little grated daikon in the dressing (it gives it the punch it needs) and the nutty-peppery mix of sunflower sprouts and daikonâ€”but any kind of fresh sprouts. While sunflower sprouts are high in fat, they contain mostly healthy unsaturated fats. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
