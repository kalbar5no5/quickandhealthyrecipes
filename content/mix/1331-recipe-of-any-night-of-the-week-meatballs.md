In a large bowl, combine eggs, water, onion, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic and seasonings; mix well. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Use ground turkey or chicken: For a lighter option, feel free to use ground turkey/chicken to make turkey meatballs or chicken meatballs.

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
