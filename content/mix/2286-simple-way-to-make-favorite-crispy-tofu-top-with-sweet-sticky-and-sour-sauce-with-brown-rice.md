Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
