Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
