Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
