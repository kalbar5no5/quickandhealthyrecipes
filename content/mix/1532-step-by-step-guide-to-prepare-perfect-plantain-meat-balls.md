Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
