Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
