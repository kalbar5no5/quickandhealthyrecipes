Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
