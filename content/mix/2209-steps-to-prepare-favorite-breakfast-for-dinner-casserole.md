Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
