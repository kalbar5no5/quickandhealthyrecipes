McDonald&#39;s Makes Green and Red Angry Birds Burgers, Just Makes People Angry. China stunt is tied to the movie. McDonalds burger buns have been far too beige, for far too long.

The sandwich — called the &#34;Super Red Burger,&#34; even though there&#39;s no beef — really takes advantage of the bird theme, containing both a &#34;smoky&#34; chicken patty and a fried egg. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
