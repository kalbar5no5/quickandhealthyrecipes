Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
