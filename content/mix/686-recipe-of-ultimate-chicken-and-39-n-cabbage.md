Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
