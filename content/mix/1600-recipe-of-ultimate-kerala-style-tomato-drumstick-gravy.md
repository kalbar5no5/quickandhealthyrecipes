Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
