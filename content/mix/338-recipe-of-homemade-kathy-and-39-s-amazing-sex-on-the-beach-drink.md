Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
