Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
