Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
