Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
