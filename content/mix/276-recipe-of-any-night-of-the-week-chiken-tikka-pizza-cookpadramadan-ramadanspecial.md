Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
