Adding garam masala makes it taste one notch up. Coriander powder is added to balance the spice level and to give thickness to the gravy. Ridge Gourd masala curry is a spicy North Indian gravy curry that tastes delicious with roti and rice. I always like to make some subji for Roti as it has healthy veggies in it. But this time, instead of the routine recipes, I used Ridge Gourd and toor dal to make this delicious Masala Curry. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
