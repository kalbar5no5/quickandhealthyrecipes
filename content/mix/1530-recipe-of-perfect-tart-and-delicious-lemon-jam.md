Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
