Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
