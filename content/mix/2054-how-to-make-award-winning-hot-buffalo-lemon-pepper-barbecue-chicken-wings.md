Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
