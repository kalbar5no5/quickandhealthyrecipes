Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
