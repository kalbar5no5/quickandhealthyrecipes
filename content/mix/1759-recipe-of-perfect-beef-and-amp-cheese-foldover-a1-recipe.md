Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
