Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
