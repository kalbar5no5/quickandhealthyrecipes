Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
