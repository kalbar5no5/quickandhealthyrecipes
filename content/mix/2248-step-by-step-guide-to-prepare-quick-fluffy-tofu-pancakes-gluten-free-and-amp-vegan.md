Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
