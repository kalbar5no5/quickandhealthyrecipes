Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
