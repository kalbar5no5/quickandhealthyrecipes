Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
