Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
