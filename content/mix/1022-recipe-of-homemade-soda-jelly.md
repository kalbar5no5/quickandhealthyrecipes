Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
