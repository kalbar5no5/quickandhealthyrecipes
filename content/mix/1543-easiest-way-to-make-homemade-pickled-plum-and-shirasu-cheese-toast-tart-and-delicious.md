Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
