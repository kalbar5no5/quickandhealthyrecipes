Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
