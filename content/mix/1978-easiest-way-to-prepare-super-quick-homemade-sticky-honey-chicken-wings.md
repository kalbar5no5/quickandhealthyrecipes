Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
