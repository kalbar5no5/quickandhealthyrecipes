Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
