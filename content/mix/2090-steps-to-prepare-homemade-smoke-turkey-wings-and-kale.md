Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
