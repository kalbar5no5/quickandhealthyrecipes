Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
