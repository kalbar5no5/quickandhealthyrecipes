Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
