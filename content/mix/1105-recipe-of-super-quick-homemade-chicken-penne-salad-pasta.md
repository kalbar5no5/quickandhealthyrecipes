Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
