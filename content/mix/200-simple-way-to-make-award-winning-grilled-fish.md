Even if assertive fish like sardines aren&#39;t typically your thing, the mellowed flavor that they take on when grilled—not to mention that crisp skin—might change your mind. The easiest method of all is to grill your fish on a plank. A plank is simply a slab of wood, usually cedar, but sometimes oak, maple, cherry or apple. A nicely charred exterior that envelops the smooth and luscious texture of the fish.

A plank is simply a slab of wood, usually cedar, but sometimes oak, maple, cherry or apple. A nicely charred exterior that envelops the smooth and luscious texture of the fish. Fish such as tuna, salmon, halibut, and swordfish, whose texture is more like beef or pork, should be grilled. Cooking fish on the grill is a great way to serve up some serious flavor in no time, not to mention that there are many health benefits of eating fish. Even with taking precautions to keep the meat from sticking, though, grilling delicate pieces of fish can be a risky business. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
