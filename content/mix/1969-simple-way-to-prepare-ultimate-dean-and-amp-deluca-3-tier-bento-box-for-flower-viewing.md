Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
