Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
