How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
