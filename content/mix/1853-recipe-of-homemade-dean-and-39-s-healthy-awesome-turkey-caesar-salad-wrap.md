Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
