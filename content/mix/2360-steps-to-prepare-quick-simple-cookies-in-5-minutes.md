Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
