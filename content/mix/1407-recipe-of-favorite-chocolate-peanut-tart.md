Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
