Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
