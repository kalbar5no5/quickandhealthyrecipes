Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
