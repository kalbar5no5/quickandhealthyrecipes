Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
