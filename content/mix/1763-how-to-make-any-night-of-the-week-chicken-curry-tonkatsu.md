Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
