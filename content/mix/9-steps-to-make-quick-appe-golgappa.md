How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
