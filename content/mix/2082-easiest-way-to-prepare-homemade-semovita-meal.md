Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
