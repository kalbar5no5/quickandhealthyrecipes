Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
