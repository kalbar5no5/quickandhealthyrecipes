Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
