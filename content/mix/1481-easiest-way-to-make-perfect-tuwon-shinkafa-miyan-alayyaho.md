Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
