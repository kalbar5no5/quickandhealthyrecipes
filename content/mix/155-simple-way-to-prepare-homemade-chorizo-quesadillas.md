Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!
