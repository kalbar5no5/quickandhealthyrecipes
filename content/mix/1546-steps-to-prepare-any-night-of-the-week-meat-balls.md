Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
