Hey everyone, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to make a distinctive dish, cocoyam soup
#abjmom #myhubfav. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Cocoyam soup
#abjmom #MyHubFav is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals in the world. It is appreciated by millions every day. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look wonderful. Cocoyam soup
#abjmom #MyHubFav is something which I have loved my whole life.

Cocoyam is a tropical starchy tuberous root crop. See recipes for Ofe Nsala w/ Chicken, Cocoyam Soup too. If you&#39;ve gotten your hands on fresh oha leaves, make a pot of oha soup. This Nigerian specialty is thickened with cocoyam paste and seasoned with smoked fish, dried shrimp, and your favorite meats.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have cocoyam soup
#abjmom #myhubfav using 7 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Cocoyam soup
#abjmom #MyHubFav:

1. Get  Cocoyam
1. Take  Catfish
1. Take  Pepper
1. Get  Palm oil
1. Prepare  Maggi
1. Prepare  Salt
1. Take  Semovita


Cocoyams can also be processed into various food products used for industrial and culinary purposes. Africans usually blend cocoyam and use it as a thickener for baking and cooking soups such as oha soup and bitter leaf soup etc. The thickening ability of oat paste is much more than that of cocoyam paste so use this Quaker Oats paste sparingly so that your soup will not be mushy, what we call gbudu-gbudu in Igbo language. This is when your Bitterleaf Soup or Ora Soup is filled with cocoyam instead of having the right balance of cocoyam and bitterleaves.

The thickening ability of oat paste is much more than that of cocoyam paste so use this Quaker Oats paste sparingly so that your soup will not be mushy, what we call gbudu-gbudu in Igbo language. This is when your Bitterleaf Soup or Ora Soup is filled with cocoyam instead of having the right balance of cocoyam and bitterleaves. When cooking Nigerian soups in which we use pastes as thickeners, we usually boil the cocoyam corms (for Bitterleaf Soup, Ora (Oha) Soup) or pieces of white puna yam (for Nsala (White) Soup), then pound them into a paste before adding to the pot of soup. But what if you live in a place where you cannot buy cocoyam corms or tubers of puna yam? As a relatively known staple crop in the underdeveloped and developing countries, it can serve as a weaning food and its own leaves are sometimes used as vegetable for cooking. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
