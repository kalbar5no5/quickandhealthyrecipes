Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them.
