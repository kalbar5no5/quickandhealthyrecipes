Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
