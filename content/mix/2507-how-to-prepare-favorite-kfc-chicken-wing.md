Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
