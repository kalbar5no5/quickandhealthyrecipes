Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
