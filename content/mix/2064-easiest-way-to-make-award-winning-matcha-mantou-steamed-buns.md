recipeingredient:
- "200 g cake flour or all purpose"
- "20 g wheat starch can replace with flour"
- "1 tbs matcha"
- "35 g sugar"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "140 g warm milk or water more or less depending on humidity"
- "1 tsp instant dry yeast or active dry"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients (everything except milk) until well combined. If using active dry yeast, keep it separate."
- "Warm milk in a small saucepan over medium heat, constantly stirring until mixture becomes lukewarm. The milk should not be hotter than 40 degrees celsius."
- "Slowly pour in warm milk into dry ingredients, continuously stirring the misture until it forms a sticky dough. If using active dry yeast, let the yeast rest in the warm milk for about 5 minutes before pouring into the dry ingredients."
- "Knead dough until it becomes smooth and does not stick to your hands (around 10-20 minutes). Leave it in the large bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let the dough rest until it doubles in size (45-60 mins)"
- "After the dough doubles in size, punch out the air and knead for about 5 minutes. Cover and let it rest for an additional 30 minutes."
- "Lightly dust your counter and dough with flour and roll it out into a large flat square/rectangle about 1/4 an inch thick. Swiss roll it up until it becomes a spiral log. Cut into 6-8 equal pieces. (You can also just roll the dough into a log and cut it into equal sized pieces :D)"
- "Lightly cover the dough pieces in plastic wrap and allow them to proof for around 20-30 minutes. (Important to get fluffy mantou!)"
- "Boil water in a steamer over high heat and steam the proofed mantou for 5 minutes (make sure to cover lid with a towel to prevent water from dripping onto your mantou!)."
- "Turn off the heat and let the mantou sit in your steamer for 5 minutes, without lifting the lid (the mantou may shrink if you skip this step). And thats it! Your steamed matcha buns are ready~ These are best served warm. Cover with plastic wrap or store in an airtight container while still warm to preserve moisture."
- "Notes: - Steamer temperatures may vary. If your mantou turns out a bit wrinkly, try steaming it over medium heat for 10-15 minutes. - I noticed that replacing the water with milk resulted in slightly lighter mantou, but did not have the mild milky taste - Add more matcha powder if you prefer a stronger matcha taste! You can also try adding two tablespoons of cocoa powder~ - The mantou will expand in the steamer so make sure they&#39;re not too close together c:"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
