If you love cornbread and tamales, this dressing is for you.

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
