Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
