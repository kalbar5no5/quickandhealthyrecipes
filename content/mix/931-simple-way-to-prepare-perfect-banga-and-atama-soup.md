Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
