Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
