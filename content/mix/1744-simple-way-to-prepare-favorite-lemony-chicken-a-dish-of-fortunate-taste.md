Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
