Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
