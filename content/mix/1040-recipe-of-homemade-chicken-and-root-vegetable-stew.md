Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
