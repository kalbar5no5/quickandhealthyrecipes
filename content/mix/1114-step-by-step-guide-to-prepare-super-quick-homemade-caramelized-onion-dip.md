Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
