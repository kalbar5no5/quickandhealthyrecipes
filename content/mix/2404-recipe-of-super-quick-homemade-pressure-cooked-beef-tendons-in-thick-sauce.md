Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
