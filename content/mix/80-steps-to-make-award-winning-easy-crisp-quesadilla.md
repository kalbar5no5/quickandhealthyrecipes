Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
