Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
