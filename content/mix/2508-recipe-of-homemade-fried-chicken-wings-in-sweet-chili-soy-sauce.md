Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
