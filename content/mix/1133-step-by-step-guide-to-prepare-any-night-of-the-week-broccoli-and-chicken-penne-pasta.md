Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
