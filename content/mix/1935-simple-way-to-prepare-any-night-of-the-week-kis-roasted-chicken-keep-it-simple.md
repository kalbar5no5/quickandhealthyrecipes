Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
