How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
