Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
