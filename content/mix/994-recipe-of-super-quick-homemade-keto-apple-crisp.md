Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
