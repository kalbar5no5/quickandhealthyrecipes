Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
