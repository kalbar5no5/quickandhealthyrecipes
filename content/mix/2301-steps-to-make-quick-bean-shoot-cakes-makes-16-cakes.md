How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
