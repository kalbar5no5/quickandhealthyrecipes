Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
