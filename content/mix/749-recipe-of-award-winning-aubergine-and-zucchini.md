Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
