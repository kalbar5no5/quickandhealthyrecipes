Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
