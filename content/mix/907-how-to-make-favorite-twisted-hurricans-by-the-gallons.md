Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
