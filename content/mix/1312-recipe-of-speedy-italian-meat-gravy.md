Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
