Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood.

The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process.
