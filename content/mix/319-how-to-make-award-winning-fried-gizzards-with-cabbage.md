Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
