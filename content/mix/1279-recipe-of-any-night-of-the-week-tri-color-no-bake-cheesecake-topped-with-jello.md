- "35 grams Plain biscuits cookies"
- "20 grams Butter salted is fine"
- " For the nobake cheesecake batter"
- "100 grams Cream cheese"
- "30 grams Granulated sugar"
- "100 ml Heavy cream"

- " Jello layer See Recipe ID 1050768"
- "1 large Citrus fruits orange iyokan decopon etc"
- "30 grams Granulated sugar"

recipeinstructions:
- "Measure the ingredients. Crush the biscuits. Soak the 4 g and 2 g of gelatin separately in water. Grease the mold with butter (not listed)."
- "Melt butter in the microwave and mix with the crushed biscuits until well blended."
- "When it comes together, pack it down on the bottom of the cake mold tightly. I do this by covering my hand in plastic wrap and pressing."
- "Chill in the refrigerator until firm. If you are in a hurry, chill in the freezer. (You don&#39;t need a paper lining if you are using a 15 cm diameter mold.)"
- "Microwave the cream cheese briefly to soften, and beat with a handheld mixer. Add sugar and fresh cream in several batches while mixing. Add  lemon juice also, and mix until smooth."
- "When the batter increases to about 1.5 times its original volume and is smooth, turn off the mixer. Warm the 4 g of softened gelatin in the microwave, and add it little by little to the batter while mixing."
- "When the gelatin is mixed in well, pour the batter into the mold. Smooth out the surface by using a spatula or shaking it a bit. Chill to set in the refrigerator. (It should take around 3 hours.)"
- "If the cream cheese is too cold in Step 6, the gelatin may coagulate and become grainy. In the wintertime, warm the cream cheese mixture until lukewarm by holding the bowl over a pan of hot water or microwaving it briefly."
- "Use whatever citrus fruit you like. The three listed above are recommended! This is iyokan. Peel the membranes. Shred apart half the pulp finely, and the other half in bigger chunks."
- "Add 30 g of sugar and mix. When the cheesecake from Step 7 has set, add enough water so that it comes up to 200 ml."
- "Heat 2 g of gelatin and add to the pulp mix. When it&#39;s cold, heat the citrus pulp to about body temperature before adding the gelatin."
- "Cool the jello well. (Put the bottom of the bowl over another bowl of cold water and mix, or chill in the refrigerator.) Pour the jello over the cheesecake."
- "Scatter the larger chunks of citrus chunks evenly while you cover the top of the cheesecake completely. Work gently so that you don&#39;t poke holes into the cheesecake."
- "Chill in the refrigerator for another 3 hours, and it&#39;s done. It&#39;s hard to unmold the cake right after it comes out of the refrigerator, so leave it at room temperature for a while."
- "Cut through for a nice look at the three different layers."
- "To soften the gelatin, add 3 to 4 times its weight in water. Be sure to soften the gelatin in water first, and then heat it up to body temperature."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
