How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
