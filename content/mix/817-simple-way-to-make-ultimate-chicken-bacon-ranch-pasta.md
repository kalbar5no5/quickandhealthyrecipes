Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
