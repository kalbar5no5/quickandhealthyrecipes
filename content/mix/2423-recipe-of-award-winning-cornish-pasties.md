How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
