Tuwo Masara (tuwon masara) is a bolus meal indigenous to the northerners(fulanis &amp;Hausas) in Nigerian and other parts of west Africa. The Northerners enjoy it with Miyan Wake, Miyan Taushe , Miyan Zogale, Miyan Ridi, Miyan Tapasa and Miyan Shuaka. Tuwon Masara or corn fufu is a bit similar to polenta as they both use corn. While corn fufu is cooked plain without any seasoning, polenta is prepared and seasoned like a porridge.

Tuwon Masara or corn fufu is a bit similar to polenta as they both use corn. While corn fufu is cooked plain without any seasoning, polenta is prepared and seasoned like a porridge. Cornmeal or tuwon masara goes well with miyan taushe, miyan busheshen kubaiwa or miyan kuka. My favourite local Nigerian meal is tuwon masara and miyan kuka also known as luru soup. Miyan kuka is made from dried boabab leaves. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
