Lebanese Chickpea Soup This delicious Lebanese chickpea soup is the perfect Middle Eastern-inspired comfort soup! It&#39;s bursting with amazing flavors and very filling due to chickpeas, potatoes, and carrots. The Lebanese cuisine is ancient and dates back thousands of years. Shish Barak is a traditional Lebanese dish, perhaps of Turkish/Ottoman origins (hence the name), which is basically made of tiny meat dumplings cooked in a plain yogurt stew. Shish Barak belongs to the &#34;Tabeekh&#34; traditional Lebanese category, ie, home stews, â€¦ Some traditional Lebanese stews tend to have the simplest of ingredients yet the loveliest of flavors, as well as loads of vitamins and fibers. &#34;Makhlouta&#34; falls within this category. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
