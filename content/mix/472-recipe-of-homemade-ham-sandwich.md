Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
