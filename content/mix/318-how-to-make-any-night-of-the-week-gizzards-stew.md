Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
