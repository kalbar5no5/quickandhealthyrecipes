Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
