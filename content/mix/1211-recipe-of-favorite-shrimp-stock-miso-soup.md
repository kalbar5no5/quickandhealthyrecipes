Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
