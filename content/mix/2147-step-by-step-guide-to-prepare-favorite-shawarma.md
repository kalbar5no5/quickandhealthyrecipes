Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
