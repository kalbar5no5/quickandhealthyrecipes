Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
