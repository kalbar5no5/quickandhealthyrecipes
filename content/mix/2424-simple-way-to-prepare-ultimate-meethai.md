Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
