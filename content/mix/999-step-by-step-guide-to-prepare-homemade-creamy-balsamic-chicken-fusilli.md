Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
