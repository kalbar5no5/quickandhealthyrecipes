Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
