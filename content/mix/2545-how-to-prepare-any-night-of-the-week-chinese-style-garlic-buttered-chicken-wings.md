Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
