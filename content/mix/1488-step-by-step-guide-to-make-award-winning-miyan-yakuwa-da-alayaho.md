Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
