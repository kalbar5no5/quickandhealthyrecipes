Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
