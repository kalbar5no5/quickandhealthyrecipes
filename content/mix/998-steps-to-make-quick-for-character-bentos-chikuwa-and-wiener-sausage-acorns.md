Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
