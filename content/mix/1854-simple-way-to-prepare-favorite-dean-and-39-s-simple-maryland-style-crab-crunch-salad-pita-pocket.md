Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
