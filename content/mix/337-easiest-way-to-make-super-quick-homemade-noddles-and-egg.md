Egg noodles in soups, pastas, or casseroles tastes great, whether it&#39;s homemade or store-bought. Egg noodles are made from the egg while some other noodles are made from wheat. Noodles fall into the category of grains and starchy foods, high in carbohydrates, and can spike up the sugar level. The blood sugar increases base on the amount you consume and the type of noodles you choose to eat. Whereas a recipe for egg noodles, known for the richer flavor and color their namesake contributes, might call for anywhere between three eggs per two cups of flour to two eggs and four yolks per two cups of flour. (Of course, you can also find yolk-free egg noodles.) Delivery available within Noodles&#39; delivery areas from participating locations. 

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
