recipeinstructions:
- "Add 2 liters of water to a pot and add the hidaka kombu. Let it soak for 1 or more hours. If possible, let it soak overnight."
- "Chicken wings and drumettes will be used to add extra flavor to the dashi. Even if you omit the other fillings, these 2 are a must!"
- "Place the chicken in boiling water and boil thoroughly for 3 minutes."
- "Place into cold water and wash off any blood and scum."
- "Boil the eggs and potatoes beforehand. (It&#39;s easiest if you pressure cook the daikon for 3 minutes.)"
- "Place 10 g of bonito into a paper pack."
- "Place the chicken and the bonito into the pot from Step 1."
- "Right before it begins to boil, remove the kombu seaweed. Without letting it boil heavily, let it simmer for 10 minutes. (It should be gently bubbling.)"
- "Make the sauce in a separate pot. First add the mirin and boil off the alcohol. Since it might burst into flames, be careful. Add in the soy sauce and light soy sauce."
- "After 10 minutes, remove the bonito from the pot. Taste the flavor and add the sauce from Step 9."

- "Gently rinse off the konbu from Step 8 to get rid of the sliminess. Cut into long thin strips."

- "Let it simmer for 20 minutes on low heat and then add your choice of paste products. Let it simmer for 10 more minutes and then turn off the heat and let the flavors combine. Warm it up once more right before eating."
- "Arrange on a dish and accompany with Japanese mustard."
- "Here are some other tips for making a delicious Oden:"
- "Boil the potatoes with the skins on so that they don&#39;t fall apart as easily. They will taste better this way. Use a paring knife to peel the skins while still hot."
- "Quickly run the ganmodoki and atsuage through hot water so that they will be able to absorb the flavors more easily."
- "Cut the konnyaku into 10mm thick slices. Cut a slit in the center of each slice and twist. Boil for about 5 minutes to get rid of the smell."
- "Rounding off the edges of the daikon radish will be easy to do if you use a peeler. If you cook them in a pressure cooker and then let them steam with the residual heat, they will become tender and will absorb the flavors of the oden easier."
- "If you&#39;re adding some aburaage pouches, run them through hot water and then wring out the moisture very well so that the flavors can be absorbed. If you roll a wooden pestle or chopsticks over the aburaage, they will easily become very neat pouches."
- "You don&#39;t need to boil the strips of dried gourd used for the pouches. Sprinkle them with salt and then rinse before using. If you boil them, they will actually thicken and become very soft which will make them hard to work with."
- "Boil the tendons in water with ginger and the green section of a Japanese leek for 10 minutes to remove the scum. Rinse with water and then steam in a pressure cooker for 10 minutes until tender."
- "Cut into easy to eat pieces and stick 3 pieces on each skewer. If you stick too many pieces onto one skewer, they won&#39;t be able to be well seasoned with the oden liquid."
- "If you boil oden for a very long time, it will start to fall apart, so quickly boil it and then let it cool. Letting it cool allows the flavors to absorb into the ingredients. Add the hanpen right before eating!"
- "Adding wood ear mushrooms is delicious!"

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
