Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
