Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
