Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
