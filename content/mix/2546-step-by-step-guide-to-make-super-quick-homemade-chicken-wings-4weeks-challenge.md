Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
