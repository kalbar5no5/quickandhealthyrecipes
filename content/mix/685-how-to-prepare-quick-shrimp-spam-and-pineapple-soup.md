Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
