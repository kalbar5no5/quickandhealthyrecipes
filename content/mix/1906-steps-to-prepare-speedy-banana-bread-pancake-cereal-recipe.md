Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
