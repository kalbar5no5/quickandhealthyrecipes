Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
