Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
