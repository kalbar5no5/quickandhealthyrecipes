Buddha bowls are awesome, they are easy to prepare, nutritious and you can eat them with just a fork, nothing to cut. That is especially useful when you want to have dinner in front of a good tv show on a fall evening (I just started watching Luke Cage by the way, great show!). It&#39;s starting to get chilly here. Put the packed bowl back in the bong being careful not to spill your schwag and ruin your hard work. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
