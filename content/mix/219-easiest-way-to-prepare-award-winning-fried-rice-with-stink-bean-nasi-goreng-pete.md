Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
