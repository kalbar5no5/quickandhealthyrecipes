Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
