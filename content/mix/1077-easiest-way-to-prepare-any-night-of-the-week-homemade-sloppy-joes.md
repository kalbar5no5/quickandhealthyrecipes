Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
