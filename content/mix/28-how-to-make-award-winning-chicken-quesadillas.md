Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
