Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
