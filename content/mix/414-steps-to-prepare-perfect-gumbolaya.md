Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
