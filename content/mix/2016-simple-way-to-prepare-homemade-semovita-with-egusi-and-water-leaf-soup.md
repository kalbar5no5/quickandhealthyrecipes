Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
