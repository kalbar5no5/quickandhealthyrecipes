How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
