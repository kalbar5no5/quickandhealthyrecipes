Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!
