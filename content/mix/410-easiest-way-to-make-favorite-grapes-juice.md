Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
