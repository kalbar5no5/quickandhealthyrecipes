Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
