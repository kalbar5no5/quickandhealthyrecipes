Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
