Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
