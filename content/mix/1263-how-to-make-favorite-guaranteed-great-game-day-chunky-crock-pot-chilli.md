Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
