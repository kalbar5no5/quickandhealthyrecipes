Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
