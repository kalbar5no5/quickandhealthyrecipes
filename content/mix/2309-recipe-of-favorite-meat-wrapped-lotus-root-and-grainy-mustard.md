Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
