Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
