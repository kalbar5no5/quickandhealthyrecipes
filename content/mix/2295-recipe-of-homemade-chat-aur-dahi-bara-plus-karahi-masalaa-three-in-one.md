Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
