Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
