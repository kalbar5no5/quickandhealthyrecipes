Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better.

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine.
