Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
