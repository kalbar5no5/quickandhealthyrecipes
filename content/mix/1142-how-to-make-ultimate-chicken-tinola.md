Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
