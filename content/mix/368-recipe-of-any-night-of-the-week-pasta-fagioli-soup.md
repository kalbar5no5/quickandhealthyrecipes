Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
