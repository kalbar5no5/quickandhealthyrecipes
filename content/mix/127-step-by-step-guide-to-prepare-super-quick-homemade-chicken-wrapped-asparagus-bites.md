Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production.

Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine.
