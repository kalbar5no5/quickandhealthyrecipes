Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
