Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
