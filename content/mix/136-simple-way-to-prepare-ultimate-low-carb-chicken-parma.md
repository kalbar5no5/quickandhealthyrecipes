Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood.

Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
