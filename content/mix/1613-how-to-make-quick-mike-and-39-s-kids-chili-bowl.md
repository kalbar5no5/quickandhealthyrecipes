Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
