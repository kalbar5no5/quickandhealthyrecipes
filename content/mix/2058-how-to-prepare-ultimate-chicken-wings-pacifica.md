Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
