Hey everyone, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to make a distinctive dish, fattoush. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Fattoush is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. Fattoush is something that I've loved my whole life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

Place romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, bell pepper, green onions, mint leaves, parsley, and cilantro into a large bowl. Season with salt, lemon pepper, onion flakes, celery salt, and garlic powder. Fattoush is a Lebanese salad, good for hot weather. This recipe uses two unusual ingredients: sumac and purslane.


To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have fattoush using 14 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Fattoush:

1. Get 2 loaves pita bread
1. Prepare  Olive oil
1. Prepare 1/2 tsp sumac
1. Take 1 heart of lettuce, chopped
1. Prepare 5 tomatoes, chopped
1. Make ready 2 cucumber, chopped
1. Get 5 green onions (both white and green parts), chopped
1. Take 3 radishes, stems removed, thinly sliced

1. Make ready  Lime-vinaigrette
1. Prepare 1 tsp ground sumac
1. Prepare 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1. Prepare 1 1/2 lime, juice
1. Get 1/3 cup olive oil


And to build their fattoush, they&#39;d simply throw the pita chips in with whatever in-season vegetables and herbs they have on hand. Coating the toasted pita in olive oil prevents it from getting soggy when mixed with the vegetables and dressing. Gradually add oil, whisking constantly, until well. At Fattoush, our chef cooks that same way; with you in mind.

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
