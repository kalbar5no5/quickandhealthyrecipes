Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
