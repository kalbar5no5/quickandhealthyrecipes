Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
