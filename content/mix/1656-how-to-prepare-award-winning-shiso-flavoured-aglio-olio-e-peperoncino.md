Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
