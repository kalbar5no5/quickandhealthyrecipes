Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
