Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
