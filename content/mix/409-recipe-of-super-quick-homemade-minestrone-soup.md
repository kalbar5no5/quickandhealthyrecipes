How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
