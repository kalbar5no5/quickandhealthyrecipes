The basic laksa is sometimes called curry laksa. The most popular curry laksas include a paste made up of shallots, garlic, turmeric, lemongrass, candlenut or cashew, and galangal. Coconut cream or milk, stock or broth, lime juice, and bean sprouts balance the bold paste along with chicken, shrimp, or tofu, or a combination. Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the curry paste and cook, stirring, for half a minute or until fragrant. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
