Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
