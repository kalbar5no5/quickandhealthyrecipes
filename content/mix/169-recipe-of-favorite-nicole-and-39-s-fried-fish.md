Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
