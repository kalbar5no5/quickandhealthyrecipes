How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
