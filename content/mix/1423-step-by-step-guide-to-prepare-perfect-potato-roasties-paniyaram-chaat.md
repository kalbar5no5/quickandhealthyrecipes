How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
