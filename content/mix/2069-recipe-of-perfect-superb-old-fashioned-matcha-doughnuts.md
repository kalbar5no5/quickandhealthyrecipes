Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
