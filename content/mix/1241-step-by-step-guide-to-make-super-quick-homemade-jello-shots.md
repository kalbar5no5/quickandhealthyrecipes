Unflavored gelatin: Use unflavored gelatin when you want the other flavors to shine. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
