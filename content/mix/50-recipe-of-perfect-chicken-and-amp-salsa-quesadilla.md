Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
