Potato Salad was always part of our holiday meals. Since regular potatoes are no good for the bloodsugar I want to change from red potatoes to cassavas. A great variety of cassava-based dishes are consumed in the regions where cassava (manioc, Manihot esculenta) is cultivated, and they include many national or ethnic specialities. As a food ingredient, cassava root is somewhat similar to the potato, in that, like the potato, it is starchy, inedible when raw. Cassava is a root vegetable that people eat worldwide. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
