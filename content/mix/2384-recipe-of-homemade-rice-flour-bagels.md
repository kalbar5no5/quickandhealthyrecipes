With the mixer on low, blend the ingredients. Add the butter, egg, and two egg whites to the dry mixture. Whip on low speed until blended. Between my gluten-free soft pretzels, gluten-free pizza, and gluten-free sourdough exploits, I was confident I could turn my assortment of Bob&#39;s Red Mill flours into gluten-free bagels from scratch. At least edible enough bagels to get me through a pound of whipped cream cheese. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
