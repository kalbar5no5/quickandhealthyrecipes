Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
