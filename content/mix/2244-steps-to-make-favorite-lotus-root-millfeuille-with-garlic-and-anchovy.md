Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood.

Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
