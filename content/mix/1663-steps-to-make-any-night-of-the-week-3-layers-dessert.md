Featuring Our Favorite Gelato Flavors with Even More Chocolatey Decadence and Crunch! I have no idea where this recipe came from, but my mom has been making it for years. It has four layers but its name says three--go figure. I add some shaved chocolate on top of the Cool Whip for presentation.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have 3 layers dessert :) using 14 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

<!--inarticleads1-->

##### The ingredients needed to make 3 layers dessert :):

1. Take 1 st layer :
1. Prepare  Digestive cookies, chocolate, butter (depends on the thickness you like)
1. Prepare 2 nd layer :
1. Make ready 1 cup condensed sweetened milk
1. Make ready 2 cups milk
1. Take 4 tbsp sugar
1. Prepare  Vanilla
1. Get 3 tbsp cornstarch
1. Get  Walnuts
1. Make ready 3 rd layer :
1. Take 1 cup milk
1. Get 100 g chocolate
1. Get 1 tbsp Nescafé
1. Prepare 1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch


What I do is place a cutting board on top of the tin, flip it upside down (it slips right out) then place a cooling rack on top then flip it again (so you end up with the right side up on the cooling rack). I&#39;ve made the layered chocolate pudding dessert a few times in my adult life, from old handwritten recipe cards and small spiral-bound cookbooks. And every time I did, I wished that the crust stayed together better and tasted a bit sweeter. I also wanted the three layers above it to have just a little more height.

With an easy cookie crust and scrumptious candy bar layers, it goes together quickly—and will disappear just as fast! —Taste of Home Test Kitchen, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Directions.

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
