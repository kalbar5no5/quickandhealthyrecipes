Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier.
