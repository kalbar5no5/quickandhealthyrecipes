I have cut the chicken Wings into Drumettes and Wingette. True buffalo wings are not breaded, but instead deep-fried until the skin becomes amazingly crispy. Then they&#39;re coated in melted butter and hot pepper sauce, giving them a glossy sheen and hot pepper kick. The sauce you use is down to you: if you&#39;re not so good with heat, try a milder one, or ramp it up to super spicy if you can handle it!

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
