How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
