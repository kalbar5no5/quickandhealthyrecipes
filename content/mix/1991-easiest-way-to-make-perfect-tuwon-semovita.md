Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
