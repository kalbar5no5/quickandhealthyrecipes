Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
