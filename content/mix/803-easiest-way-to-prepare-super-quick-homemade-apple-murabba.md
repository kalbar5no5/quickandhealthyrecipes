How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
