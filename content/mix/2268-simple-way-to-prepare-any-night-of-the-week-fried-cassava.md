How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
