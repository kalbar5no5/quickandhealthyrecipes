Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
