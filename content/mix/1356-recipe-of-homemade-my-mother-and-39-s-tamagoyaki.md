Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
