Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
