Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
