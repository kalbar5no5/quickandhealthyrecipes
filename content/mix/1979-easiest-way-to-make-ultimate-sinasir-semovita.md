Fisherman&#39;s soup with Oatmeal and chopped lightly boiled Okro Ofada rice and Ayamase (ofada sauce) Unripe Plantain Pottage. Indomie Jollof and fried plantain with boiled eggs Fried fish and vegetables with Egg sauce and Irish. Sinasir is a flat masa, made by simply pouring the prepared rice paste into a frying pan, thus avoiding the need to flip it over as would be necessary with masa. This is a predominantly Hausa food. Alkubus is Hausa-Fulani steamed bread made from wheat, flour, yeast and water, put in moulds and steamed. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
