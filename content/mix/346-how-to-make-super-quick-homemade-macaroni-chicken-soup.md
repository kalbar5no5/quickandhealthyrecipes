Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
