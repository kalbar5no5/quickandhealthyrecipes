Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
