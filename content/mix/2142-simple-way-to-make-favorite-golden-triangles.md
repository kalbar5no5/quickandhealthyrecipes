Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
