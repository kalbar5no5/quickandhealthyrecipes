Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
