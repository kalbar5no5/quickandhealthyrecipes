Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
