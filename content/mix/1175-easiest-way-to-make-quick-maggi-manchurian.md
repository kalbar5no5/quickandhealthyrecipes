Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood.

These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier.
