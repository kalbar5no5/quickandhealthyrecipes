Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
