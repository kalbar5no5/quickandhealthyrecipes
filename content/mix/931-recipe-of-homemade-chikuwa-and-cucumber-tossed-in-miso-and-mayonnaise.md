Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
