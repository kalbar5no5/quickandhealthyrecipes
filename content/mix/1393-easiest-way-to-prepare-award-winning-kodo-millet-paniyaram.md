Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
