Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
