Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
