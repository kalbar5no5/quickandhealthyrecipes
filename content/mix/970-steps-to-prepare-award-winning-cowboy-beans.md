Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
