Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
