Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
