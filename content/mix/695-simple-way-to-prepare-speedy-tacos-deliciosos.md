Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
