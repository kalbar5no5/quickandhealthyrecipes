Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
