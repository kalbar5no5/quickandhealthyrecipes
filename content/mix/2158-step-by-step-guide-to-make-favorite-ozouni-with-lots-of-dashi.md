Kanto style is a clear broth made of dashi served in the Kanto region of eastern Japan (Tokyo). Kanto style Ozoni soup is made with Kelp (konbu) and bonito (Katsuo) dashi base with soy sauce flavor. Because the soup is so simple, it is important to make the Dashi right. This excellent dashi broth is full of umami coming from kombu. We&#39;re making Ozoni, Japanese Mochi Soup, whose clear soup gives it a beautiful presentation. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
