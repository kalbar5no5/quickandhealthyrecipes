Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
