How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
