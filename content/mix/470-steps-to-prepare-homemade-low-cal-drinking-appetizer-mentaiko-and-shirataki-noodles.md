Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
