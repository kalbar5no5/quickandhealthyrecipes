How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
