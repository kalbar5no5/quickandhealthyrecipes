Melt butter in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-low heat; whisk in flour until smooth. The people that complain of a thin sauce either live at very low altitude or their roue wasn&#39;t cooked enough when they started adding the milk and cheese. Also, grainy mac and cheese is the result of adding the cheese too quickly. To ensure a smooth texture, add it slowly and melt completely before adding more, which the recipe didn&#39;t explain. Pour in more water during simmering, if needed, to keep gizzards covered. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body.
