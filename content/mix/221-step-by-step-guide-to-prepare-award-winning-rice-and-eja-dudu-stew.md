Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
