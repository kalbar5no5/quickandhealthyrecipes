Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
