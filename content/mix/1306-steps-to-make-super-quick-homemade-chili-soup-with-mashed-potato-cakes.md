Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
