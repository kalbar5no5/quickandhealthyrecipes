The golgappa pani or spicy water is made of mint leaves in some places and in some places its jaljeera pani or hing pani or amchur (dried mango) pani. The meetha pani is the usual sweet tamarind chutney. In this post I have shared jaljeera made from mint leaves and spices. Many like to enjoy it alone by just adding boiled mashed potato, coriander, few drops of lemon and a sprinkle of chaat masala powder. Making golgappa puri at home is is easy but time consuming affair if you want to prepare it in large quantity and so generally, I prefer to buy them from grocery store. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on.

Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!
