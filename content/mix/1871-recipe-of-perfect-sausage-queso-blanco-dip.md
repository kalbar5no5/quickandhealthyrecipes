Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
