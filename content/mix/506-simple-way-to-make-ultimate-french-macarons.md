recipeingredient:
- " Macaron Cookie Shells"
- "1 3/4 cup confectioners sugar"
- "1 cup finely ground blanched almond flour"
- "3 large egg whites at room temperature"
- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- " Filling Options"
- " buttercream frosting"
- " chocolate ganache"
- " fruit jam"
- " cream cheese frosting"
- " nutella"
- " lemon curd"
recipeinstructions:
- "Begin by separating the eggs. This is easier to do when the egg is cold, so separate the yolks from the whites and then let the whites sit out for an hour or so to come to room temperature. Line 2-3 baking trays with either parchment paper or silicone baking mats and set them aside. Use a fine mesh sieve over a medium bowl to sift the confectioners sugar and the almond flour, then set that aside."
- "Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a hand mixer, beat the egg whites on low speed until they become frothy. Then, with the mixer still running, gradually add in the granulated sugar. Increase speed to high and continue to mix until stiff peaks form. If using food coloring, add in a couple of drops of gel food coloring at this time."
- "Add the sifted dry mixture to the whipped egg whites. Then use a rubber spatula to very gently fold the batter together. Once the ingredients are incorporated in, continue to fold until the batter slowly runs off the spatula...as the batter falls off of it back into the bowl, it should briefly hold its shape before sinking into the batter. It&#39;s important not to undermix or overmix, as both will result in the cookies not coming out right."
- "Prepare a piping bag with a round top and place the batter into it. Pipe circles about 1 1/2 inch to 2 inches wide about 1 inch apart from each other on the prepared baking sheets. Try to be as consistent as you can with the sizes. Once done piping, tap the sheets 3 or 4 times against a hard countertop or table. This will release air bubbles from the piped batter."
- "Let the piped batter sit out for 15 minutes and up to 1 hour, until a &#34;skin&#34; develops. When you can touch the piped batter and your finger comes away dry, they are ready to be baked. Preheat the oven to 300°F."
- "Bake them for 7 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for 7 minutes more, or until they release easily from the parchment. Bake 1 batch at a time. They should have risen up slightly and developed a crinkly bottom, called &#34;feet&#34;. Transfer them very carefully onto a cooling rack to cool completely."
- "When they are cooled completely, match up couples that are similar in size. Place a small amount of whatever filling you&#39;d like to use onto the bottom center of half of the cookies. Then gently twist an unfilled cookie shell over the top of a filled one, to make a macaron. The cookies are delicate, so be careful not to crack the shells."
- "That&#39;s it! You are finally done and ready to enjoy your macarons. Store these wrapped tightly in the fridge for 3-4 days. Allow them to come up to room temperature before serving."
- "For these pictured, I colored them with 2 drops of red gel food coloring and I just filled them with a basic vanilla buttercream frosting: 1 stick softened butter, 2 1/2 cups confectioners sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, a pinch of salt and anywhere from 2-4 tbsp of heavy cream. Beat the butter using a hand mixer until soft and creamy, then beat in the rest of the ingredients until it reaches your desired consistency. Place in a piping bag and pipe onto the macaron shells."

Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
