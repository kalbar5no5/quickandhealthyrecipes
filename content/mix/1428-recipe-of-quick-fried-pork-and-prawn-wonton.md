recipeingredient:
- "340 g ground pork"
- "250 g peeled prawn roughly chopped"
- "2 tablespoon finely chopped spring onion"
- "1 teaspoon sesame oil"
- "1 tablespoon soy sauce"
- "1 tablespoon chinese cooking wine"
- "1/2 teaspoon sugar"
- "1/2 tablespoon oyster sauce"
- "1 tablespoon peanut oil"
- "2 tablespoon water plus more for sealing the wonton"
- "50 wonton skin"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by making the filling. Simply combine the ground pork, chopped scallions, sesame oil, soy sauce, wine, sugar, oil, water, and white pepper in a bowl."
- "Whip everything together by hand for 5 minutes or in a food processor for 1 minute. You want the pork and prawn to look a bit like a paste."
- "To make the wontons, take a wrapper, and add about a teaspoon of filling. Overstuffed wontons will pop open during the cooking process and make a mess. Use your finger to coat the edges with a little water (this helps the two sides seal together)."
- "For shape #1:"
- "Fold the wrapper in half into a rectangle, and press the two sides together so you get a firm seal."
- "Hold the bottom two corners of the little rectangle you just made, and bring the two corners together, pressing firmly to seal. (Use a little water to make sure it sticks.)"
- "For Shape #2:"
- "Fold the wonton in half so you have a triangle shape. Bring together the two outer corners, and press to seal (you can use a little water to make sure it sticks)."
- "Keep assembling until all the filling is gone (this recipe should make between 40 and 50 wontons). Place the wontons on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking."
- "At this point, you can cover the wontons with plastic wrap, put the baking sheet/plate into the freezer, and transfer them to Ziploc bags once they’re frozen."
- "They’ll keep for a couple months in the freezer and be ready for the fryer whenever you’re ready."
- "To conserve oil, use a small pot to fry the wontons. Fill it with 2 to 3 inches of oil, making sure the pot is deep enough so the oil does not overflow when adding the wontons."
- "Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry in small batches, turning the wontons occasionally until they are golden brown."
- "If you have a small spider strainer or slotted spoon, you can use it to keep the wontons submerged when frying. This method will give you the most uniform golden brown look without the fuss of turning them."
- "Remove the fried wontons to a sheet pan lined with paper towels or a metal cooling rack to drain."
- "Serve it with siracha and kwepee mayonaise."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
