Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
