Uthappam is a type of dosa from South India. Unlike a typical dosa, which is crisp and crepe -like, uttapam is thicker, with toppings. The name is derived from the Tamil words Appam and Utthia or Uttria, meaning Poured-Appam. Because Appam is cooked on a round bottom pan, whereas Utthia-Appam is cooked on a flat skillet.

The name is derived from the Tamil words Appam and Utthia or Uttria, meaning Poured-Appam. Because Appam is cooked on a round bottom pan, whereas Utthia-Appam is cooked on a flat skillet. Uttapam (aka Uttappa or Oothapam) is yet another healthy breakfast recipe from South Indian cuisine prepared with a common rice and urad dal batter used for preparing Idli and dosa. However, unlike Dosa , Uttapam is little thicker and is topped with different types of veggies like onion, tomato, capsicum, carrot, green chilli, sweet corn etc. Oothappam or Uttapam or Uthappa, literally means &#39;poured appam&#39; in Tamil. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
