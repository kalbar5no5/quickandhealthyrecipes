Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
