How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
