Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
