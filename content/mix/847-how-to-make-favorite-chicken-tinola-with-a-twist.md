Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
