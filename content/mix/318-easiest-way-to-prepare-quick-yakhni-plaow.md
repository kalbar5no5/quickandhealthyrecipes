Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
