Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
