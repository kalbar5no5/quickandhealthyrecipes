Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
