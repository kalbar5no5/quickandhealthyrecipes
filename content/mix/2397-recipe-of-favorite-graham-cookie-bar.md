Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
