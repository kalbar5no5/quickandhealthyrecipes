Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
