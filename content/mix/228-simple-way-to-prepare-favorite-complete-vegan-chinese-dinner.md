Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
