Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
