Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
