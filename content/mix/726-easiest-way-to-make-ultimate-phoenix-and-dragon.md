A long time ago, two dragons, one a prince and the other a princess, met and fell in love. Tough, clever and beautiful, biracial detective Liza Bowman stru. A Phoenix egg falls from the sky into the sea dragon realm, there the egg hatched into a beautiful and innocent little girl and when she wakes up there is a handsome (but dumbfounded) Dragon beside. I&#39;m going with a phoenix based on the following. The dragon and phoenix are considered a perfect couple and a symbol of love in Feng Shui, which is why they are believed to be an auspicious symbol that invites matrimony bliss. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
