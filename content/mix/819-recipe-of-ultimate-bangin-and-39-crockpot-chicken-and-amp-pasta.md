Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
