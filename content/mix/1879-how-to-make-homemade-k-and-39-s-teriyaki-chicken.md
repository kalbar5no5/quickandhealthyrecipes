Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
