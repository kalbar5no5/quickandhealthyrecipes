Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
