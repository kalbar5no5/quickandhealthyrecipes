Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
