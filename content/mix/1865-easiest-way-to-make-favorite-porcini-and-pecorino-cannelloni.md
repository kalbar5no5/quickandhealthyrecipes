Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
