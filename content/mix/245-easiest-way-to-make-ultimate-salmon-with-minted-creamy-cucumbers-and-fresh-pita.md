recipeingredient:
- " Hero Salmon"
- "3/4 each Vidalia onion thinly sliced"
- "12 oz fresh salmon filets"
- "2 tsp Penzeys Greek seasoning"
- "1/2 each lemon thinly sliced"
- "2 each oregano sprigs"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "2 each fresh pita bread"
- " Minted Creamy Cucumbers"
- "2 each cucumbers thinly sliced"
- "1 tsp kosher salt"
- "1 cup Atlanta Fresh yogurt"
- "1 each Vidalia onion thinly sliced"
- "1 each lemon juiced"
- "10 fresh mint leaves chopped"
- "1 each garlic clove minced or chopped"
- "1 Penzeys Greek seasoning to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a small, oven-safe dish, make a bed of sliced onions to rest under the salmon. Season the salmon filets liberally on all sides with the Greek seasoning, and place skin-side down (if the skin is removed, this is the side with the gray ?bloodline?). Arrange the sliced lemon, and oregano sprigs on top of the fish. Pour the olive oil over the fish, allowing it to coat the onions at the bottom of the pan. Let stand 15-20 minutes at room temperature. Preheat oven to 400ยบ F."
- "As oven preheats, make the minted creamy cucumbers. Mix the cucumbers and salt in a colander or strainer, over the sink or a bowl. Let stand 10-15 minutes. Squeeze gently, and blot dry on paper towels, or tea cloth. While the cucumbers are soaking, combine the lemon juice, mint, garlic, onion and yogurt in a medium bowl. Next, stir in the strained cucumbers. Add Greek seasoning to taste. Place aside in refrigerator while the salmon cooks."
- "Place the dish with the salmon on the bottom rack of the oven. Allow to bake until the salmon is just fully cooked, approximately 15-20 minutes. Fully cooked salmon is opaque, and firm when squeezed gently from the sides. Remove salmon from the oven, turn the oven off, and place the pita directly on the rack in the still-warm oven. Allow the salmon to rest for about 5 minutes while the pita warms. Remove and discard the lemon and oregano from the top of the salmon."
- "Place the salmon on one side of the plate, and top with some of the cooked onions. Place a mound of cucumbers next to the salmon. Cut the pita into eight slices and arrange next to the salmon and cucumbers. Or enjoy as a sandwich: Cut the pita in half to form two pockets, fill each half with layers of large flaked chunks of salmon, onions, and minted cucumbers. Enjoy!"

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
