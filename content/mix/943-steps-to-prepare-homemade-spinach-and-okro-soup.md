Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
