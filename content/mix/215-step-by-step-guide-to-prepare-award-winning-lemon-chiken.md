Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
