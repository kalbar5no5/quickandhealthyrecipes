Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
