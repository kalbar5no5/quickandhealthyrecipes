Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood.

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them.
