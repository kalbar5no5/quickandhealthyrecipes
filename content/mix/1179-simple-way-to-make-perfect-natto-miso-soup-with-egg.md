Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
