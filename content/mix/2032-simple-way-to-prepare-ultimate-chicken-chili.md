The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving!
