Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
