Kadhi pakora or Punjabi kadhi is the perfect vegetarian comfort food from North India. Vegetable fritters (pakoras) are coated in a chickpea flour mix and fried to golden-brown perfection. The pakoras are then dipped in a sunshine-yellow sauce (kadhi) made with yogurt, chickpea flour, turmeric and other spices. Kadhi, or karhi, is a yogurt-based curry popular in various forms throughout the Indian subcontinent. In the Punjabi version, chickpea fritters (pakoras) are doused in a hearty yogurt-based gravy and topped with a spice-infused tadka, or tempering. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
