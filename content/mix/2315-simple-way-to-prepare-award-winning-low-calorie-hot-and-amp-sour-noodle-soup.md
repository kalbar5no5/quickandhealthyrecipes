Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
