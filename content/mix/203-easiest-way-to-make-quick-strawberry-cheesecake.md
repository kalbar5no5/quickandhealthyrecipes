Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
