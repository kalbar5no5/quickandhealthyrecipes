Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
