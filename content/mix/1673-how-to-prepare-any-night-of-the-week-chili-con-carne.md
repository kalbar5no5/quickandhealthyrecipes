How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
