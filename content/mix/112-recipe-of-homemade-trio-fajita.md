Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
