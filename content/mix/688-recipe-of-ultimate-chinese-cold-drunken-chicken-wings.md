Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
