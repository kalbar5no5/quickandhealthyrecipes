Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
