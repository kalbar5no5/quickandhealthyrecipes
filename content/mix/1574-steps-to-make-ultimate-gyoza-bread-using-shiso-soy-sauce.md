Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
