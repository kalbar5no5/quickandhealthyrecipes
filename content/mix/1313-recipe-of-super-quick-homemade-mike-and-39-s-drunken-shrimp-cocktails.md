Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
