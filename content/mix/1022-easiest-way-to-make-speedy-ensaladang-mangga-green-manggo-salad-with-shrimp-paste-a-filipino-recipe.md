How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
