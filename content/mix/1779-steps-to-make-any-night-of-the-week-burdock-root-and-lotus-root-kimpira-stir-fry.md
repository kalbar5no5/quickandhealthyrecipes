Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera.

The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats.

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine.
