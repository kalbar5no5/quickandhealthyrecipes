The longer you can soak the saffron in milk before-hand the better the flavor! (Prep time includes chill time). Saffron Uses Another exciting thing about this saffron recipe is that now we have a second recipe that calls for saffron. I love a good paella, but it&#39;s a bit of an undertaking, so it&#39;s not on my normal rotation in any way shape or form. For a recipe that gets its flavor, aroma and color from saffron like these cookies, you want high quality saffron. A hefty pinch goes in the mortar and pestle, then grind it up and steep with a tablespoon of hot water. 

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
