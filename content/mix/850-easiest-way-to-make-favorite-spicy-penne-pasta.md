Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
