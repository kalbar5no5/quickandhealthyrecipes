Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
