Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
