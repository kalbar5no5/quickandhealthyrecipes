Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
