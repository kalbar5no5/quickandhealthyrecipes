Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
