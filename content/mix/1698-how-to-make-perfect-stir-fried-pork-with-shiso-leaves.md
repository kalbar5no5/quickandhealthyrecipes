How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
