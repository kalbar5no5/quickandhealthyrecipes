How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
