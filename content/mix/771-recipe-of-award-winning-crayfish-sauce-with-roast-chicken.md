Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
