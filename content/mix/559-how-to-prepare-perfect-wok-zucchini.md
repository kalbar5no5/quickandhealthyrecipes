Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
