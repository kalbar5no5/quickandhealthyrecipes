Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
