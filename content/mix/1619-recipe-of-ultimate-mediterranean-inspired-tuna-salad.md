Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
