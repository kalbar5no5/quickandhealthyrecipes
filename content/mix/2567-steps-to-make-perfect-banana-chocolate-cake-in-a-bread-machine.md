Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
