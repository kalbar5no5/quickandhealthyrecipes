Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
