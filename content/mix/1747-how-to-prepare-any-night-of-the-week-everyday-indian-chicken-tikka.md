Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
