recipeingredient:
- "2 packs (17 oz.) Hawaiian rolls"
- "4 cups shredded cheddar cheese"
- "2 lbs hamburger meat"
- "1 can (14.5 oz.) diced tomatoes with garlic and onion drained"
- "24 bacon strips"
- "1 cup butter"
- "1/4 cup brown sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Grab a pan, toss it on the stove, set the burner to medium heat. Throw the hamburger meat in the pan."
- "Set oven to 350, precisely. Cut the glorious Hawaiian Rolls in half so you have a top and bottom bun. Lay the bottom of your Hawaiian Rolls into a large dish. Layer with 2 cups of cheese. Place in the oven for 3 minutes to let the cheese melt onto the buns... My picture shows the cheese a little too done. Dang."
- "Prepare your bacon. I usually get microwaveable bacon because I guess I’m just disgusting but I got regular bacon for you guys. So either microwave the bacon or throw it on a cookie sheet and let it get crispy in the oven. Microwaving is faster."
- "The hamburger meat, bacon, and bottom bun layer should be done. Drain the diced tomatoes and then add to the hamburger meat. Go ahead and sprinkle the meat and with some salt and pepper."
- "Layer your sliders. Add the hamburger meat, then the bacon, next the rest of the cheese, and lastly the top buns."
- "Add your butter and brown sugar to a bowl. Microwave it until the butter is melted. 23 seconds? Mix the two beautiful ingredients together and then glaze your buns."
- "Bake at 350 for 20 minutes. The top of the buns should look golden and crispy and delicious. Take it out, let it cool, and dig in!"

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
