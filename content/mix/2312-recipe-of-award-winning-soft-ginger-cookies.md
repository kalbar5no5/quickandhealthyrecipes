Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
