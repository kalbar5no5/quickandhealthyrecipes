Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
