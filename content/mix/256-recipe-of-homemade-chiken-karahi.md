This is my way of making restaurant-style Chicken Karahi! I share in this video the key ingredient that makes the curry so flavorful and intense. The Pakistani chicken karahi is garnished with fresh coriander, freshly sliced ginger and fresh chilies, that you can adjust for heat, to your liking. Sometimes yogurt is added into the Pakistani chicken karahi itself, or it can be served with raita, which is a creamy, yogurt sauce flavored with cucumber and mint.

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
