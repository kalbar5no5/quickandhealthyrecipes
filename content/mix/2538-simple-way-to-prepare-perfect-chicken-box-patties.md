Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
