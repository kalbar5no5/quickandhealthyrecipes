Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
