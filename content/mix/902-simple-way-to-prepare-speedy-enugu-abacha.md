Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
