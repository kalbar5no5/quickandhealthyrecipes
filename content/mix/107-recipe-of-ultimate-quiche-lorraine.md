recipeingredient:
- "225 g plain flour"
- "Pinch fine salt"
- "60 g cold unsalted butter cut into roughly 1cm dice"
- "60 g cold lard cut into roughly 1cm dice"
- "3-5 tbsp very cold water"
- "175 g streaky bacon rashers rinds removes cut into strips"

- "125 g Gruyere cheese grated"
- "2 large eggs"
- "250 ml single cream"
- " Salt  freshly ground black pepper"
- " Freshly ground nutmeg"
recipeinstructions:
- "First make the pastry: put the flour into a bowl and mix in the salt. Add the butter and lard and run into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs."
- "Now work in just enough cold water to bring the dough together. When it begins to stick together, gently knead it into a ball, but be careful not to over work it. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for around 30 minutes, while you make the filling."
- "Crisp the bacon in a pan over a medium heat for 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. Leave the juices in the pan."
- "Place the onions in the pan and cook over a medium head for 8 minutes, or until golden. Transfer this to a separate plate. Leave to cool."
- "Heat your oven to 200 degrees fan and have ready a 23cm fluted loose-based tart/flan tin, 3.5cm deep."
- "Roll out the pastry onto a lightly floured surface to a 3mm thickness and use it to line the tart tin, leaving the excess hanging over the edge. Keep a little uncooked pastry back in case you need to pack any cracks later. Prick the pastry base with a fork. Line the pastry with baking parchment or foil and then fill with baking beans, or uncooked rice or lentils."
- "Bake blind for 15 minutes, then remove the parchment and baking beans and return the pastry to the oven for about 8 minutes, or until it looks dry and faintly coloured. Trim away the excess pastry for the edge. Use a tiny bit of the reserved raw pastry to patch any cracks or holes if needed. Turn the oven down to 180 degrees."
- "Place the cooled bacon into the pastry case, then the onions, then top with the cheese. In a bowl, whisk gentle together the eggs, cream, salt &amp; pepper to combine, then pour into the quiche. Top this with some freshly ground nutmeg. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden and just set. Be careful not to overcook, or the filling will become tough and full of holes."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
