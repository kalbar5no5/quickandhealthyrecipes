Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
