Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
