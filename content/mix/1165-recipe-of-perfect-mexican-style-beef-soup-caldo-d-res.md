How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
