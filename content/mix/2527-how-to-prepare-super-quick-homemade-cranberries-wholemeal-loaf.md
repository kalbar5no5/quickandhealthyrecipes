Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
