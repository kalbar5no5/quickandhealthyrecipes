Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
