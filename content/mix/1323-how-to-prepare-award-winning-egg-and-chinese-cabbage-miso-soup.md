Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
