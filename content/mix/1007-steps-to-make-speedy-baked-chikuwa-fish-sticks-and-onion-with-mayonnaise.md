Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
