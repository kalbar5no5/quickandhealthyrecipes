Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
