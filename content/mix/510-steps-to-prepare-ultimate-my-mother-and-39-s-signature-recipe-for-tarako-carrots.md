Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
