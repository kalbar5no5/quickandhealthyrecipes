Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
