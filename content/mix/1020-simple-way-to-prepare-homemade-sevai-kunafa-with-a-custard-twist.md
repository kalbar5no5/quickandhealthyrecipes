How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
