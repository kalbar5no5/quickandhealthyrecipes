Shawarma is probably one of the most recognizable Middle Eastern ethnic food names in the West, behind Falafel and Hummus. This is a flavorful chicken dish, which I first tasted at a little Lebanese restaurant. While normally shawarma is sliced off a rotisserie, it can be made at home with just a few changes. Be warned, it takes a day of prep time.

Due to the unavailability of such industrial roasters at homes, Chicken Shawarma has typically remained a restaurant dish. Shawarma is a middle eastern spiced beef or chicken sliced thinly with fresh veggies and tahini sauce (also known as tarator) or garlic aioli for the chicken. It is one of the most well-known Lebanese cuisines. Homemade beef Shawarma can be just as delicious as the crispy and juicy street food you know and love in the middle east. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
