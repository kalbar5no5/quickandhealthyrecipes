Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
