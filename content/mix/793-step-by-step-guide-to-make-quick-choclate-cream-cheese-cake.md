Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
