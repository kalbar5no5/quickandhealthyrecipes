Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
