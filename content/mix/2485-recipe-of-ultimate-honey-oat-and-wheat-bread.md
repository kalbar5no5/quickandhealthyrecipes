Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
