Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
