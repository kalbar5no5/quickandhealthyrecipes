Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
