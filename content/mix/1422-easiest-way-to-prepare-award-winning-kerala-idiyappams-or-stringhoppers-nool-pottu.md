recipeingredient:
- "2 cups Rice Flour"
- "2.5 cups Water"
- "1 tsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "To start with, roast the flour slightly for 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat. Do not over roast it. It should not change colour too. It is perfectly okay if you do not roast it. I make it both the ways."
- "Simultaneously heat water in an Idli cooker or a big vessel. Grease the idli plates or if banana leaf is available, cut small pieces and place in each depression of the idli plate."
- "Do not allow it to come to a rolling boil. As soon as it starts bubbling, switch off the gas. In a bowl, add roasted rice flour and salt. To this, add hot water and mix with a spatula."
- "When the heat can be handled, use your hands to knead the dough. It should be a smooth dough. Use some water if it appears dry. Use a string hopper with small hole attachment for making the Idiyappams. Divide the dough into two parts. Cover it with a cloth to prevent it from drying."
- "Make concentric circles in a clockwise motion in each depression of the idli plate. Steam them for 10-12 minutes. Keep them warm in a casserole. Serve them hot with Chicken curry, Sambar or Coconut Chutney. Just about anything you like. Enjoy!"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
