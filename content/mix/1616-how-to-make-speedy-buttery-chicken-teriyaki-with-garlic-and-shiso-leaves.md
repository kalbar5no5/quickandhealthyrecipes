Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
