Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
