Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
