Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
