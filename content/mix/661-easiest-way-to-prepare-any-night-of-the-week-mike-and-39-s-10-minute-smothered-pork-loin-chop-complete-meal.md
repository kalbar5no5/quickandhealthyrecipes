Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
