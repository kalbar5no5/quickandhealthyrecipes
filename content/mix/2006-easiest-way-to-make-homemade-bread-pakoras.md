How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
