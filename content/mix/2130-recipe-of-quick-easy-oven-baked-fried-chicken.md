Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
