Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
