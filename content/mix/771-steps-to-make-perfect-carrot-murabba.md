Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!
