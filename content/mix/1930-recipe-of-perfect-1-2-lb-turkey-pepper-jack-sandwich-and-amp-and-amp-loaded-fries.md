Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
