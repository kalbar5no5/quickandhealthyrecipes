Whether you make your taco soup on the stovetop or in the slow cooker, the process is basically the same: start by browning the ground beef and onion in a pot.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
