Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
