Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
