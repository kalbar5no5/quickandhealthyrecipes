I could not get enough of it. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
