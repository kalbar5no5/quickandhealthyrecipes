Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
