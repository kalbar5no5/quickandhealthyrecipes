Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
