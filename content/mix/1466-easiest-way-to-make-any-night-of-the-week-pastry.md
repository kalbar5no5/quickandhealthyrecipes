Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
