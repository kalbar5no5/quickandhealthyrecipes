Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
