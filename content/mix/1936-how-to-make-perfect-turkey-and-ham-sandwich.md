How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
