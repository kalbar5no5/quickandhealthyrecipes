Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
