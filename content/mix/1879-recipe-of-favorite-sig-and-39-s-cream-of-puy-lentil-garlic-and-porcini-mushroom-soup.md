Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
