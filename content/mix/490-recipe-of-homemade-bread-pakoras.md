Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
