Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
