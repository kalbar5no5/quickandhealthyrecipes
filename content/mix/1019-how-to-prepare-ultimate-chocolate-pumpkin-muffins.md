Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
