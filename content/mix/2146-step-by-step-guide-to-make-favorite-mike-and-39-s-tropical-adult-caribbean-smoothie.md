Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
