Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
