This Frito Pie was more like a salad. Frito pie is a flexible casserole that you can customize with other stir-ins such as minced green chilies, sliced black olives, diced tomatoes, chopped onion or frozen corn kernels. Both New Mexico and Texas claim to have invented Frito pie. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
