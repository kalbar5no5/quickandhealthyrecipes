Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
