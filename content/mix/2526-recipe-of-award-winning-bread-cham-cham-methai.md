The recipe looks much similar to Rasgulla, but these Cham Cham&#39;s are much more tastier than the conventional Rasgullas.

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
