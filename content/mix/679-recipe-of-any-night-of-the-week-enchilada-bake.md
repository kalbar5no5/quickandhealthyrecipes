Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
