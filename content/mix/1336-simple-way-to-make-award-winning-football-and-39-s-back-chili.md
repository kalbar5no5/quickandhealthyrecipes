Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed.
