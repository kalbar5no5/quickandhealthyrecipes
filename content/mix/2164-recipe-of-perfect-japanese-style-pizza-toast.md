How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
