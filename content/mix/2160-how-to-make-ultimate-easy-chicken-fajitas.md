Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
