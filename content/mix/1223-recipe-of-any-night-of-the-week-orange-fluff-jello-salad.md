Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
