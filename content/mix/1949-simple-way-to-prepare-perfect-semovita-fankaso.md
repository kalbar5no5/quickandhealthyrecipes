If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body.
