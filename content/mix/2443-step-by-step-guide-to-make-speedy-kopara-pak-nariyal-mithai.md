Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
