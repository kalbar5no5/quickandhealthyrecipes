Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
