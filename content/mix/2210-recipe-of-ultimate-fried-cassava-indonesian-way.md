Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
