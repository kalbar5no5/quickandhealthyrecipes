Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
