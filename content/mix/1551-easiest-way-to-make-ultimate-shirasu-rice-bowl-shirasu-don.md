Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
