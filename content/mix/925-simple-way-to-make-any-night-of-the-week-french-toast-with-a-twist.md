Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
