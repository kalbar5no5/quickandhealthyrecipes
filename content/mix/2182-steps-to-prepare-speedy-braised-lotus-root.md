The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine.
