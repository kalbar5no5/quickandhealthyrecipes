Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
