Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
