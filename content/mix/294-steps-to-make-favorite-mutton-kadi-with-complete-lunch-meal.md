Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
