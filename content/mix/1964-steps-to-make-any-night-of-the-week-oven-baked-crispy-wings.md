Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
