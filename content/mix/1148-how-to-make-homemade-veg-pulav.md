Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
