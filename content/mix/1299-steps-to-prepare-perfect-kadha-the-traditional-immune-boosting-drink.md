Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
