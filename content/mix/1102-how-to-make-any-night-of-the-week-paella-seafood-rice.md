Although paella originates from Valencia, it&#39;s recognized as the national food of Spain and there are several different varieties. Paella is a rice based skillet dish originally from the Valencia region of Spain on the Mediterranean coast. For this reason, most Spaniards would say truly authentic Paella is made with seafood, just like it was first made on the coast. Add the rice to the pan and stir to thoroughly coat the rice grains with the oil and juices from the pan. Rice or &#34;arrow&#34; in Spanish is the most important part of any Paella. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
