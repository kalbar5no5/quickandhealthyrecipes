Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
