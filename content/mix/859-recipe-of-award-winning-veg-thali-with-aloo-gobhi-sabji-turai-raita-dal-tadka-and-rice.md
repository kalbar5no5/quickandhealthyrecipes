I served curd mixed with onion and a sprinkle of red. So when I am making a full thali I try to make a simple dry sabzi. Today&#39;s sabzi is again a simple tadka in onion , followed by tomato, spices and veggies. Oil used is very less, just to saute the onion. The sabzi is cooked on slow to medium flame. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
