Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
