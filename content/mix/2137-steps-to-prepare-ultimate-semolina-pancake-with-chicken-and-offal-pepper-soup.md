&#34;There&#39;s no such thing as a real Italian brunch,&#34; says Albert Di Meglio, chef and partner of Brooklyn&#39;s Barano. While many restaurants in New York City opt for lemon-ricotta pancakes, Di Meglio took a different approach with his semolina pancakes. Unlike baghrir, the thin and savory Moroccan semolina pancake with lots of tiny holes, this Italian-style pancake is thick and hearty but not. Into the semolina batter, stir in salt and pepper, two chopped tomatoes and two chopped green chilies.

Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
