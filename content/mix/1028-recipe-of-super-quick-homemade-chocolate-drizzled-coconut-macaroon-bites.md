Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
