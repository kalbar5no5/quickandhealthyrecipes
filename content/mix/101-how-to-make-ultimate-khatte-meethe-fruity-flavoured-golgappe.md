Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!
