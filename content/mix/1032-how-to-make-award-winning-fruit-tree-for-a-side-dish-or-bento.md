How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!
