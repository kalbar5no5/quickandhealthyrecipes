Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
