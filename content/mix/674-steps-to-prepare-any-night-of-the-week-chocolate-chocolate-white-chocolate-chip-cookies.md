Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
