Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
