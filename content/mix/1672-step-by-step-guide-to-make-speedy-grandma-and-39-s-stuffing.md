Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
