Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
