This Creole dish of Spanish and French origin made with rice and a variety of fiery spices, like paprika and red pepper, with your choice of chicken, ham, sausage and seafood -- or any combination of meats and seafood! Jambalaya is a rice dish from southern Louisiana, featuring the spicy sausages and seafood local to the region. There are a few theories about the origins of jambalaya: Jambalaya may have originated as a variation of West African jollof rice; or it may have emerged during the Spanish occupation of Louisiana during the late eighteenth century, its name a portmanteau of jamÃ³n (ham) and paella. Jambalaya usually has at least a small amount of &#34;heat,&#34; but you can tone it down (or up!) according to your liking.

There are a few theories about the origins of jambalaya: Jambalaya may have originated as a variation of West African jollof rice; or it may have emerged during the Spanish occupation of Louisiana during the late eighteenth century, its name a portmanteau of jamÃ³n (ham) and paella. Jambalaya usually has at least a small amount of &#34;heat,&#34; but you can tone it down (or up!) according to your liking. You can also choose your sausage based on the amount of spiciness you want your jambalaya to have. For example, kielbasa is a type of mild sausage that&#39;s great for kids or those who don&#39;t like spicy foods. This quintessential dish from New Orleans is a spicy one-pot rice dish featuring chicken, andouille sausage, shrimp, and a whole host of Southern flavors. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
