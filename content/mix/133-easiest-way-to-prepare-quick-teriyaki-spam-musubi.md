Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
