recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Strong bread flour"
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "140 grams Milk"
- "20 grams Salted butter"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "4 grams Dry yeast"
- "3 grams Salt"
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "50 grams Butter"
- "50 grams Sugar"
- "1 Egg yolk"
- "3 grams Matcha"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the cookie dough using the ingredients marked with ＊. Cream the butter and add the sugar. Blend together and once smooth, add the egg yolks and mix. Mix in the matcha before folding in the flour with a spatula. When the dough isn&#39;t powdery anymore, split it into 6 equal pieces and leave to rest for over 30 minutes."
- "Now for the bread dough. Add the milk and butter to a heat-resistant bowl and warm to body temperature in a microwave. When the butter has completely melted, add the sugar and yeast and mix."
- "Add 1/3 of the powder ingredients and mix wiith a whisk until smooth. Add the rest of the powder ingredients and fold in with a spatula."
- "Wrap the dough in cling film and heat in a 200W microwave for 30 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a dusted work surface and knead until it is no longer sticky. If the dough is still a bit sticky, you can fix this with dusting the dough with more flour. When you can round the dough into a smooth, taut ball, wrap it up and cover with a damp cloth for 15 minutes."
- "Punch out the excess air and separate the dough into 6 equal pieces. Separate each piece so that you have 2/3 for the body and 1/3 for the head, feet and tail. Separate each head, feet and tail section into 1/4 for the head and split the rest into 5 equal pieces to make the 4 legs and a tail. Use your finger to squash down the areas where you will attach the pieces together. (I used cocoa when I took this photo which is why the dough looks darker than yours will)."
- "Take the cookie dough from the fridge and roll out each piece into a circle shape between 2 sheets of cling film. Rest each cookie circle on top of the turtle bodies you made out of breasd dough earlier and carve a criss-cross pattern into the cookie dough with a knife. Once you attach the head and feet it will be impossible to move the turtles without breaking them so place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and continue."
- "Fix on the feet, head and tail by applying left over egg white onto the flattened area of each body piece and attaching to the body. (Again, the photo used here features a recipe where I used cocoa which is why it appears dark)."
- "These turtles will expand quite a lot so make sure to leave plenty of space between them on the baking tray. Keeping these turtles on the baking tray, microwave them at 200 W for 30 seconds, cover with a damp cloth and leave to proof for 25 minutes. They should become twice as big as their original size. Bake for 25 minutes at 200°C."
- "This time I made 2 pandas, 2 turtles and 2 crocodiles. Each recipe variation requires the same ingredients and amounts so you can mix and match like this."

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
