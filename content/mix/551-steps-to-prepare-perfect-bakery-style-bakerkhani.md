Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
