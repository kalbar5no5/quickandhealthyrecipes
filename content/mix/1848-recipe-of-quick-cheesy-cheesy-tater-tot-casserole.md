Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
