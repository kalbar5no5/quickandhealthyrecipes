Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
