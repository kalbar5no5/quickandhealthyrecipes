Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
