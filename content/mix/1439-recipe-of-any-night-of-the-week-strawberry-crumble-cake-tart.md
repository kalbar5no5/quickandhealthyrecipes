Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
