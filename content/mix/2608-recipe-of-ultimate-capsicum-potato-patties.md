Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
