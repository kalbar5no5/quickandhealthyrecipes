Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
