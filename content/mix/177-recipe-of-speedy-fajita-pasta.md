Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
