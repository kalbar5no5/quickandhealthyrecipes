- "1 small onion"

- "1 lb dried split peas rinsed"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "4 cup chicken or vegetable stock"
- "1 cup water"
- "1 salt and pepper"
- "4 oz bacon ends diced small"
recipeinstructions:
- "In large Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until most of the fat has rendered.  Reserve a few bits of bacon for garnish.  Spoon off all but one tablespoon of bacon fat.  Keep the bacon fat in a clean container in your freezer, and use it for other things like roasting potatoes, eggs, chickens, etc."
- "Add vegetables to pot. Let them cook until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5-7 minutes.  Add peas and toss with vegetables until evenly coated with bacon fat.  Add bay leaves, stock, and water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat.  Let simmer until peas are tender, about 45-60 minutes.  Periodically skim the top of soup of grease.  If soup seems too thick, thin out with more stock or water."
- "When peas are tender, you can leave the soup alone if you want it chunky.  I like to purée the soup so it is creamier.  Just stick an immersion blender into soup and blend as much as you like.  You can also transfer half of soup to regular blender or food processor, then add the blended soup back to the unblended half."

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
