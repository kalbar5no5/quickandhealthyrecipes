Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
