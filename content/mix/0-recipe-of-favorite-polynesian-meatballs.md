Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
