Semolina is a high-gluten flour made from hard durum wheat. It has a rather coarse texture, yellow color, and is high in gluten protein. The high gluten content means the flour is especially well suited for making pasta, but this flour is also a common ingredient in bread and baked goods as well as couscous.

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
