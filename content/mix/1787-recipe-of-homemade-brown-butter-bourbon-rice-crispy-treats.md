Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
