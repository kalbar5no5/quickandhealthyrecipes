Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
