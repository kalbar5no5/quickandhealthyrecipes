Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
