Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
