Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
