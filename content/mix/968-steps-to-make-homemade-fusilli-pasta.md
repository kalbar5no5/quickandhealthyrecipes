Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
