Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
