Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
