Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
