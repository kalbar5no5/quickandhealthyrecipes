How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
