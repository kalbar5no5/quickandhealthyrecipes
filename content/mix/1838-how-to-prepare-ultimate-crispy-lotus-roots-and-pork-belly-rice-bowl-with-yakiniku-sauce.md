Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
