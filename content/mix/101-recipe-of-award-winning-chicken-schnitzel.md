Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
