Valencian speakers use the word paella for all pans, including the traditional shallow pan used for cooking the homonym dish. The pan is made out of polished or coated steel with two side handles. Nourishing, vibrant, and served without pretension, paella has held a place of honor and practicality in Spanish homes for centuries. If mussels aren&#39;t your favorite, you can easily substitute littleneck clams in their place--just be sure to thoroughly scrub the clams&#39; shells in cold water before using. Add chorizo and cook until crisp, then remove from skillet. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
