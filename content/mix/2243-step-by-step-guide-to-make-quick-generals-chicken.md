Okay, so in my humble opinion, when ordering General Tso Chicken, Sesame Chicken or Orange Chicken from a Chinese restaurant, the base sauce reicpe is the same, they simply add spice to the General Tso, sesame seeds to the Sesame Chicken, and orange peel (with a little spice) to the Orange Chicken. General Tso&#39;s chicken gets a makeover with this homemade marinade, crisp coating, and sweet and salty glaze. General Tso Chicken is a favorite Chinese food takeout choice that is sweet and slightly spicy with a kick from garlic and ginger.

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
