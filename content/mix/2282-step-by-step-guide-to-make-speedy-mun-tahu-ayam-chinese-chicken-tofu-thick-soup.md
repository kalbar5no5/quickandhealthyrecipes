How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
