Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
