I&#39;ve always loved corn fritters, but they weren&#39;t satisfying as a main dish. I came up with this recipe and was thrilled when my husband and our three young boys gave it rave reviews. For the Fritters: Heat chicken and broth in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat to simmering. Reduce heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer. Make sure to cook the chicken fritters at medium-low temp, otherwise, they will burn on the outside and won&#39;t get well cooked in the inside. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
