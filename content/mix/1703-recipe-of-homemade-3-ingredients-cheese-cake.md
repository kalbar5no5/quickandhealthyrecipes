Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
