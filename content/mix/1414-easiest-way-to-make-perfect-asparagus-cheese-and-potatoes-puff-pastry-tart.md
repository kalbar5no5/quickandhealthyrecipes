Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
