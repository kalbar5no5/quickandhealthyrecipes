recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Thinsliced beef pork or chicken also OK"
- "2 large Potatoes"
- "1/2 to 23 of a large one Onion"
- "1 tbsp SugarA"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauceA"
- "1 tbsp SakeA"
- "400 ml Dashi stock Its OK to use instant dashi granules mixed with water at about the same strength youd use in miso soup"
- "1 tbsp SugarB"
- "1 tbsp MirinB"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauceB"
- "2/3 to 1 tablespoon Soy sauceC"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the beef into reasonable bite-size pieces. Cut the onion into wedges about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Chop the potato into 3-4 cm chunks."
- "Spread just a little vegetable oil (even better if you use suet) in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat, and brown the beef in it."
- "Once the beef has browned, add in the onions and potatoes and stir-fry them together."
- "Once the oil has coated all the ingredients a bit, add the A seasonings, and stir-fry / simmer. Stir continually so that the items don&#39;t stick or burn, continuing until the ingredients have blended well and started to absorb the colors of the seasonings."
- "Add the B ingredients and turn the heat up to high to bring it to a boil."
- "Once the pot boils, cover the ingredients with an otoshibuta / drop lid (this is a must) that sits right on top of the ingredients inside the pot, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Simmer like this for about 20 minutes."
- "Be careful not to let the pot boil too briskly. Set the heat so that the simmering liquid just gently bubbles through the holes in the otoshibuta."
- "After 20 minutes, turn the heat down to the lowest setting, and take out a larger of the potato chunks to check its softness. The flavor will still be weak at this point."
- "If the potato still seems too firm, put the otoshibuta back on, turn the heat back up, and simmer for 3 more minutes. If the potatoes seem tender after this, remove the otoshibuta and drizzle in the C seasonings."
- "Turn the heat up to high, and boil for about a minute, gently swirling the pot occasionally to keep the potatoes from falling apart."
- "You could just eat the nikujaga as it is at the end of Step 10, but I recommend putting a lid on the pan and letting the contents cool for a bit (this also allows the potatoes to absorb even more flavor), and then it&#39;s done."
- "When you&#39;re ready to serve the nikujaga, warm it up carefully so that the potatoes don&#39;t fall apart, and then serve into bowls."
- "Rather than keeping the potatoes completely smooth and intact, it deliciouos when the potatoes are dense and floury."
- "This is a simple recipe that makes for a really flavorful, very delicious nikujaga."
- "Try to make this when you have plenty of time and can let the nikujaga cool down and really absorb the flavors before eating."
- "If you want to add in shirataki noodles, do so between Steps 6 and 8."
- "There is also a recipe for &#34;Waterless Nikujaga&#34; made in a Staub cocotte ronde (a round thick-bottomed cat iron pot) at. Please have a look!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/150645-waterless-nikujaga-simmered-meat-and-potatoes-in-a-staub-cocotte"

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
