Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
