1. Get 5 lb shrimp, peeled and de-veined
1. Prepare 1 lb imitation crab meat
1. Make ready 5 lb fresh limes

The reason is because ceviche (sev-ee-chay) is still very much raw fish or seafood. The citrus bath the seafood sits in does turn the meat opaque, giving it the appearance of being cooked, and it does kill some of the many wee beasties present in raw foods that can make you sick, notably the toxin vibrio. Rinse scallops and place in a medium sized bowl. Pour lime juice over the scallops.

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
