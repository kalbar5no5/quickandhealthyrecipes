Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
