Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
