Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
