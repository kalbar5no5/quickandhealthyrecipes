Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
