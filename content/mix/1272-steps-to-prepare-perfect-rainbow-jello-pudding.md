Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
