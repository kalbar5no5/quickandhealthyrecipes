Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
