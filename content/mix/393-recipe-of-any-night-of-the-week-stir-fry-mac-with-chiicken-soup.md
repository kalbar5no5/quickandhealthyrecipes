Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
