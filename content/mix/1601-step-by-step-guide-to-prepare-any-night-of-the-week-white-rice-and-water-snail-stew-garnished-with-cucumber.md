Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
