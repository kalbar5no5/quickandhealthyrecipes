Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
