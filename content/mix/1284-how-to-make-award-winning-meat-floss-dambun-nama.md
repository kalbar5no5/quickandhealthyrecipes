Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
