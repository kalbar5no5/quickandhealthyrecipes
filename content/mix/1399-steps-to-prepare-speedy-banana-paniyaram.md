Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
