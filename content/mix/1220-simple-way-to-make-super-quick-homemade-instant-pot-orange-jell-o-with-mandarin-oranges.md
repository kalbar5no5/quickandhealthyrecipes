Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
