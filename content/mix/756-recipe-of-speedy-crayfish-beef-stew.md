Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!
