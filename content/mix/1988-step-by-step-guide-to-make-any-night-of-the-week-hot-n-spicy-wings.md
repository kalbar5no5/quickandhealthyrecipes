Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
