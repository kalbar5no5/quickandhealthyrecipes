Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
