Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
