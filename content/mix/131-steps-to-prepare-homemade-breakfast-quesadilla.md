Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
