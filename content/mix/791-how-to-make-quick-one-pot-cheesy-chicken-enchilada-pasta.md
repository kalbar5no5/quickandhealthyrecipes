Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
