Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
