- "1 Kabocha squash"

recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the carrot and lotus root and slice them with a mandoline. The kabocha squash is quite hard, so be careful not to injure yourself when preparing it."
- "Soak the lotus root slices in water for a while to prevent them from changing colour. While the lotus root is soaking, start heating the rest of the vegetables up in the microwave."
- "If you slice the carrot into strips rather than circles it&#39;ll be harder to burn them."
- "Pat the vegetables dry and arrange them on a large plate without them overlapping. If you want to season the vegetables with salt, do it now!"
- "Then put the plate in the microwave and heat the vegetables for 1-2 minutes. Then turn the vegetables over and cook them for another 1-2 minutes (this will help the vegetables to cook faster and the end product will be prettier).  Be careful not to burn yourself!"
- "Since these vegetables contain less moisture than potatoes or sweet potatoes, they will cook quicker. They&#39;re easy to burn though so please be careful."
- "When the moisture has all evaporated and the vegetable slices are dry and crispy, they&#39;re ready to eat."

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
