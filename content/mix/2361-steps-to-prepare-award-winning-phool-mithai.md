Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
