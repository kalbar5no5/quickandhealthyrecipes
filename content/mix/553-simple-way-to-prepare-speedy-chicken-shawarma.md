Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
