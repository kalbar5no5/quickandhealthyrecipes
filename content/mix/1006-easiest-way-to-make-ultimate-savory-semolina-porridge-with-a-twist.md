Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
