Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
