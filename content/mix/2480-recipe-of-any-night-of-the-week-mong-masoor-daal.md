Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
