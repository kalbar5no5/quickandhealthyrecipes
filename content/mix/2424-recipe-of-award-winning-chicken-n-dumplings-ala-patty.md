Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
