Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
