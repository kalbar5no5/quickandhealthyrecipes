- "If seeking a vegetarian option, reserve your tomatillo juices to thin your salsa. This, instead of chicken broth."

- "° Blend until desired consistency.                                                           ° If opting for a creamy avacado salsa - blend or smash avacado separately and mix it in your salsa once salsa has cooled."

- "Simmer for 15 minutes."
- "° If you feel your salsa is too acidic due to the tomatillos, jalapeños and chiles, while salsa is at a high simmer - add 1/4 tsp Baking Soda. Mix well. Your salsa will foam up but she&#39;ll settle right down. Add another 1/4 tsp at a time until you&#39;re satisfied with the acidity.                                                                                                                                                       ° Definitely add 1/3 cup of your favorite green purchased salsa! And, it&#39;s not cheating! It has preservatives that will tame the acid considerably. Add it last as your salsa cools down. Pedros is a great brand! Spicy but delicious!"
- "Serve hot or chilled with guacamole and sour cream to tame the heat. Also, with tortilla chips, tacos or burritos. Enjoy!"

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
