recipeingredient:
- "3 Chicken tenders"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
- "1 tbsp Sake"
- "5 or 10 slices Processed cheese slice"
- "5 or 10 Shiso leaves"
- "1 optional Tubed umeboshi paste"
- "10 Spring roll skins"
- "1 Flour dissolved in water"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the sinew from the chicken tenders. If you push down with a fork and then pull it up, it will be easy to take off. If you wrap the sinew in a paper towel, it won&#39;t be slippery."
- "Place the chicken in a heat-resistant dish, sprinkle on some salt, pepper, and sake, cover with plastic wrap, and then microwave for 2 minutes. When the chicken is cooked, tear it apart into fine pieces."
- "Slice the cheese and shiso leaves vertically in half. To make it more decadent, you can place 1 whole leaf and 1 whole slice of cheese in each spring roll."
- "Place the chicken on top of the cheese (umeboshi, optional) close to the bottom corner edge of the spring roll skin as possible. Place the shiso leaf at the opposite corner and wrap it up from the bottom."
- "If using a whole shiso leaf, place it as shown in the photo."
- "Roll to look like this picture, then finish wrapping to look like the picture in Step 7 so that half of the shiso leaf can be seen through the skin. Slide the leaf to adjust if necessary."
- "Wrap until the end and then seal the edge with watered down flour."
- "Heat up vegetable oil in the frying pan and fry the spring rolls until they are lightly browned."

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
