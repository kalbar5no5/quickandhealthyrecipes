Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
