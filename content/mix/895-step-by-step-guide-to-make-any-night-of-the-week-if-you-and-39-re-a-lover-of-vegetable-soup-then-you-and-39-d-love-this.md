Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
