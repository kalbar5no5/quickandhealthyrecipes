Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
