Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
