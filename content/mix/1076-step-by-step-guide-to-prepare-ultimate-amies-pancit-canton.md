Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
