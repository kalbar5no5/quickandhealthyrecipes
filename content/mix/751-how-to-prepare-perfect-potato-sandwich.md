Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
