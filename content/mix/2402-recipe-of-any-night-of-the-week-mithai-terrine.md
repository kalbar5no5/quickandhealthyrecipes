- "For the Rabdi - Take a heavy bottomed pan and bring milk to a boil. Let it simmer on low till the milk reduces to ½ it&#39;s original quantity, add the condensed milk and mix well. Add the saffron soaked milk and the almond silvers and set aside to cool."
- "For the Gulab Jamun - Prepare the sugar syrup by bringing the sugar and water to a boil. Add the crushed cardamom. Knead the Khova, Maida and the soda into a smooth, uniform and crack free dough and make roundels. Do not press them very hard, but ensure the surface is crack free. Heat oil in a pan on low flame. Drop the jamuns one by one but do not overcrowd. Fry them on low flame till golden brown in colour. Add the jamuns to the sugar syrup and let them soak well."
- "Mix the sugar, water and crushed cardamom and bring to a boil. Let the sugar syrup cook till it reached a 1 string consistency.  Mix besan with enough water to achieve the consistency of a dosa batter. If the batter is too thick the boondi will be difficult to drop into oil and have tails.

Do not let the boondi change colour."
- "Line a pan (Use a bread mould) with foil or butter paper. Place a thick layer of boondi over this. Place Gulab Jamuns on the boondi and spread them evenly.Heat the rabdi. Take Carrageenan or Agar Agar and dissolve it in about 50 ml water. Add it to the warmed rabdi and stir well. Now take a sieve and pour the rabdi over the boondi and gulabjamun and allow it to cool.Set it in the refridgerator for atleast 6 hours or preferably overnight."
- "Once Set, Dip the pan in warm water and invert the plate over a serving platter. Garnish with chopped pistachios and dried rose pertals and serve cold."

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
