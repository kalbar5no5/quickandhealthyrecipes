Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
