Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
