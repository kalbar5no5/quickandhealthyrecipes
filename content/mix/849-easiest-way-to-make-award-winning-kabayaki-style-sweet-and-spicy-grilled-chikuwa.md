Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
