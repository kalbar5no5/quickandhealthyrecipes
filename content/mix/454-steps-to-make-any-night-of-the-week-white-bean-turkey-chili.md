Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
