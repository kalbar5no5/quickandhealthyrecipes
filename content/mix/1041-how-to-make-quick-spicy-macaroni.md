Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
