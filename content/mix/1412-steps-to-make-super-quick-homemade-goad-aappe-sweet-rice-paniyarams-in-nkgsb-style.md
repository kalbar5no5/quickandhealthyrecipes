Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
