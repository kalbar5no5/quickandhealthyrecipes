Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
