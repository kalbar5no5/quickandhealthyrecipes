Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
