Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
