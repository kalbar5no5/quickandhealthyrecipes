Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
