Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
