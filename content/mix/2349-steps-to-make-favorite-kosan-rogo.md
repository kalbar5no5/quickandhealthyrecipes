Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
