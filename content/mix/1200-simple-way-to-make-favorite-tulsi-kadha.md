Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
