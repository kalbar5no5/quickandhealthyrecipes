The fat (usually butter, but sometimes shortening or lard) adds moisture to the dough and helps the cookie brown as it bakes. The sugar not only sweetens the cookie, but it also tenderizes and helps the cookie maintain its soft, sugary bite. Shortbread often has just three ingredients. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
