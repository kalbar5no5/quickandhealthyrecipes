These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
