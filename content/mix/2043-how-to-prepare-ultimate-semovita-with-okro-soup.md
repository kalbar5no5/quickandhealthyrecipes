Okra soup is one of the most popular Nigerian soup, I like this soup because it is very easy to prepare and likely the cheapest soup in Nigeria. Wash and chop the okro into small pieces. Many people confuse two words &#39;semovita&#39; and &#39;semolina&#39; as both of these can be used to make &#39;swallow&#39; and eaten with soup. At the same time, semovita is similar to semolina, which is made from wheat (the type of wheat influences the final color). The Okro and vegetable version Which i like to call Okro Vegetable soup is common with the Igbos and most of south eastern Nigeria. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
