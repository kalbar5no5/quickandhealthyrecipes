Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
