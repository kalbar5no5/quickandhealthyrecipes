Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
