Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
