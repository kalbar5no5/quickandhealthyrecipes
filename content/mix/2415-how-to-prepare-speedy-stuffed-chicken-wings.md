Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
