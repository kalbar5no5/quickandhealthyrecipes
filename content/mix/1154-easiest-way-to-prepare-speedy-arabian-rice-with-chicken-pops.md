Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
