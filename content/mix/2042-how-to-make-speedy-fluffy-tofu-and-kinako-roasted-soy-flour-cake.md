Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
