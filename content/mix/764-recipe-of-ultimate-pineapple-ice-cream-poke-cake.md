Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
