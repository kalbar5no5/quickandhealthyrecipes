Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
