Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
