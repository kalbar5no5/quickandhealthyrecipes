Chicken wings marinated in fermented shrimp paste add up to one umami-packed treat, clothed in crisp-fried skins and brimming with juices. Seriously, who doesn&#39;t enjoy the occasional meal of deep-fried chicken? In fact, I find it very hard to resist this local dish of fried prawn paste chicken that we call har cheong gai in the Cantonese dialect. We love to celebrate a festive occasion with a dish of prawn paste chicken, because it&#39;s everybody&#39;s favourite. The way to make Har Cheong Gai is unique amongst other fried chicken recipes in that the chicken is not just marinated first and then either dipped into a batter or dusted with a flour mixture before deep frying. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
