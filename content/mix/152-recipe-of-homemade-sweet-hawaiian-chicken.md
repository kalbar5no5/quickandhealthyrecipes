Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
