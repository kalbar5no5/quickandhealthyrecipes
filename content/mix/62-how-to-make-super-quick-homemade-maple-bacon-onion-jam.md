Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
