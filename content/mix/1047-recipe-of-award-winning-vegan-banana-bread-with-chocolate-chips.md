Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
