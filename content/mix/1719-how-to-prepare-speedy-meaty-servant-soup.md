Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
