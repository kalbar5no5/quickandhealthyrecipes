Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
