Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
