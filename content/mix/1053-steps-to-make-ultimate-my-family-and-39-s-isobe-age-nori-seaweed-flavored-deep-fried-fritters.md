Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
