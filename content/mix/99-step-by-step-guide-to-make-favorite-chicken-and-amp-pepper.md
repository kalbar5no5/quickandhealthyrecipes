Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
