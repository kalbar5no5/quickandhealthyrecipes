Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
