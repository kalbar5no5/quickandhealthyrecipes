Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
