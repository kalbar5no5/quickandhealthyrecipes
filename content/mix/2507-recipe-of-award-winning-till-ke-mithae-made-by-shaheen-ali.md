Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
