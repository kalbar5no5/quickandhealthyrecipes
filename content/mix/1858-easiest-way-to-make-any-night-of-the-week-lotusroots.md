How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
