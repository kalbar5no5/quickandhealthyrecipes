How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
