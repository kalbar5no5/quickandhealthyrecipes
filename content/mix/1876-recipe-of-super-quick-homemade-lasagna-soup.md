Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
