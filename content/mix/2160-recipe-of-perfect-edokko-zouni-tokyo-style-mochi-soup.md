Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
