Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true.

They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished!
