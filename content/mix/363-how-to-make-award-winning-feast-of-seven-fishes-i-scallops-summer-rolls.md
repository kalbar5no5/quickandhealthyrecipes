Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
