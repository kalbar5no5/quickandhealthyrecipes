Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
