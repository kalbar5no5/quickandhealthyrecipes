##### The ingredients needed to make Stuffed Bagel:

Inspired by Milk Bar&#39;s visionary Christina Tosi and her &#34;Bagel Bomb,&#34; we bring you our version of a bagel roll stuffed with cheddar and cream cheese filling and showered with our everything bagel topping. Each Stuffed Bagel Mini is a little larger than a golf ball, so that&#39;s at least two to three bites worth of bagel goodness. The bagels come two to an order, which is perfect for snacking, but if you&#39;re really hungry or want to make a full meal of them, you might want to snag two orders. While the bagel balls are resting, bring your poaching liquid ingredients to a boil over medium heat.

The bagels come two to an order, which is perfect for snacking, but if you&#39;re really hungry or want to make a full meal of them, you might want to snag two orders. While the bagel balls are resting, bring your poaching liquid ingredients to a boil over medium heat. Remove and place on parchment paper. Stuffed Bagel Minis are available in two flavor varieties, Plain and Everything, both filled with plain cream cheese. The Classic Plain bagel stuffed with plain whipped cream cheese. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
