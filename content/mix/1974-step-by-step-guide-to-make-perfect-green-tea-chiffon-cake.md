Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
