Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
