Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
