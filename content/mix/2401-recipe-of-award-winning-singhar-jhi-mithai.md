Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
