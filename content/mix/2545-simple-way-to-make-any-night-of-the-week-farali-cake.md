Rasmalai Cake Unlike the Gulab Jamun Cheesecake recipe I&#39;d shared earlier, this Ras Malai Cake doesn&#39;t have any ras malai tucked into it. Instead, \this one uses the concept of a &#39;ras malai&#39; and adapts it to a cake. The cake, is a sponge cake, sliced in half and brushed with a milk syrup and frosted with a mascarpone frosting. Farali uttapam presents an unique variation to the south indian staple uttapams. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
