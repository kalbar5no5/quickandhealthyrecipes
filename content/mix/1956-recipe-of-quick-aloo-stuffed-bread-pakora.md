Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
