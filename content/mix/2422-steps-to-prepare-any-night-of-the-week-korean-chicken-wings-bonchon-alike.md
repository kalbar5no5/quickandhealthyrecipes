Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
