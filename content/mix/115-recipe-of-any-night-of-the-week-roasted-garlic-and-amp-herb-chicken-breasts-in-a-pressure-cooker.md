Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
