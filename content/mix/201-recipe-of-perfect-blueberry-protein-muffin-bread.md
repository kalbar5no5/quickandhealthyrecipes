Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
