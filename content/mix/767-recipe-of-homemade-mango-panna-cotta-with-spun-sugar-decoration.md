Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
