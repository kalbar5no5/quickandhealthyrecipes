Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
