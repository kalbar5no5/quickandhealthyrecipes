Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
