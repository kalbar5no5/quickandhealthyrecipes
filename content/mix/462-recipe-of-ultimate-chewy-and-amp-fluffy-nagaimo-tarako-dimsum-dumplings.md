Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
