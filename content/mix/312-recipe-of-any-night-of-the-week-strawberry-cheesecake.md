Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
