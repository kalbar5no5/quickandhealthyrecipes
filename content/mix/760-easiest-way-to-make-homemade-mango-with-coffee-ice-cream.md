There was Sitaphal Mastani, Pineapple Mastani, Vanilla Mastani, Orange and Rose Mastani, Pista Mastani, Chocolate Mastani and Mango Mastani to name a few. Combine mangoes, cream, brown sugar, and corn syrup in a blender or food processor. Wrap in a plastic bag so the bowl stays clean. In a blender, add mango, ¼ cup sugar, and lemon juice and puree until texture is smooth. This is because using plain pureed mango that hasn&#39;t been reduced has a much higher water content and the water is what causes the icicles. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
