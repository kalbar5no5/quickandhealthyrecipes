Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
