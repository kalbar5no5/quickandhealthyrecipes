How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
