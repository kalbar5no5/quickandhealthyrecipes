Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
