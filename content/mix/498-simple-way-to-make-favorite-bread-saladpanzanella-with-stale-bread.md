Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
