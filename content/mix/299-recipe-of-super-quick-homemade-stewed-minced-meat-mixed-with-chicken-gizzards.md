Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
