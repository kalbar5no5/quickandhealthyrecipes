recipeinstructions:
- "In a large pot, add everything except for the 8 Roasted Hatch Peppers, Potatoes and Hamburger. Boil for approximately 45 minutes. You may not need all 3 boxes of beef broth."
- "Fry hamburger meat in a separate pan. Leave hamburger in larger chunks. Drain if necessary. Place in pot with vegetables."
- "Once vegetables are getting semi soft, add diced potatoes."
- "Boil an additional 30 minutes."
- "In the last 15 minutes of simmering, add your 8 Roasted Hatch Green Chili&#39;s (peeled and de-seeded) and your remaining Cilantro to the simmering pot."
- "Some of the flavors in your spices can deplete with long simmer times. With this, I taste test to see if I need more Cumin or Italian Seasoning just prior to serving. I also add Garlic and Onion Powder as well but that&#39;s totally up to you. ;0)"
- "Since you&#39;re using green tomatoes, your stew may taste too acidic. Instead of adding sugar to remedy the acid, add 1/4 tsp Baking Soda to your boiling pot and mix in. Be careful since the sodas reaction will cause your stew to foam up and possibly over momentarily if pot is filled too high. Repeat 1/4 tsp at a time until you&#39;re pleased with the acidity level. A general rule of thumb is 1/4 tsp Baking Soda per every 6 Tomatillos or Red Tomatoes."
- "Serve hot with warm flour Tortillas. The Tortillas are meant to tear and dip into your stew."
- "Authors Note: This recipe containing hamburger meat is the cheapest version of this dish and it&#39;s quite common for larger families with compromised incomes here in New Mexico. You can make this stew with pork shoulder 1&#34; cubes or sirloin cuts. Even chicken is an option. However, if you do choose pork or beef cuts, your stew will require at least 2 hours simmer time. You will also want to lightly season flour your meat with the spices already listed above and brown it with your garlic and onions. Then place them in your broth and additions."
- "If you&#39;re interested in purchasing Hatch Green Chile&#39;s, Google, &#34;Hatch, NM Green or Red Chile&#39;s for sale.&#34;"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
