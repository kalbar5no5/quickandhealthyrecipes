Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
