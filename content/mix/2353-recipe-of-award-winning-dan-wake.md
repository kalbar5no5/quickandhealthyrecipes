How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
