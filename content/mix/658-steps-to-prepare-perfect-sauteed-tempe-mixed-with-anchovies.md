Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
