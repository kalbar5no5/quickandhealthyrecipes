Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
