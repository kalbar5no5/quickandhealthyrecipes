Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
