What really makes this dish is the gochujang mayonnaise (we&#39;ve used Lady&#39;s Choice here), which binds the tuna and kimchi together. It adds a signature spicy sweetness you can only get from Korean food, and goes perfectly well with the melty, cheesy topping, mimicking that popular Korean fried chicken + cheese sauce pairing.

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
