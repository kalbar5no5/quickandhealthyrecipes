Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
