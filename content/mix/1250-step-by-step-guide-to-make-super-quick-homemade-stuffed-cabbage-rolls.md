Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
