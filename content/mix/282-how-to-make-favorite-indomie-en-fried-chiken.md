Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
