Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
