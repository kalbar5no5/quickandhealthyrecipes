Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!
