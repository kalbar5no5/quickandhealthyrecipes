Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
