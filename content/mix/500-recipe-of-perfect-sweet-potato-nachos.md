Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
