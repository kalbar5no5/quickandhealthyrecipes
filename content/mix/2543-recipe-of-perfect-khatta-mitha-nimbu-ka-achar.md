Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
