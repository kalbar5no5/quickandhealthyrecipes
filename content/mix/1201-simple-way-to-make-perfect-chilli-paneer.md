Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
