Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
