Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
