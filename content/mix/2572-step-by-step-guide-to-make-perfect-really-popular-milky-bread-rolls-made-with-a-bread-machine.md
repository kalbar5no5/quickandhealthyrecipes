- "Bake in an oven preheated to 180°C for about 15 minutes, and it is done!"
- "These rolls have a milky, subtly sweet fragrance! Eat with pasta or stew. They&#39;re also delicious on their own!"
- "If you break the rolls apart like this after they&#39;ve cooled down a bit and still warm, they&#39;re so fluffy and moist!  I recommend this bread for kids with egg allergies."

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
