How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
