Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
