Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
