Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
