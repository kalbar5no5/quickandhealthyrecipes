Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
