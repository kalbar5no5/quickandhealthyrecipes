How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
