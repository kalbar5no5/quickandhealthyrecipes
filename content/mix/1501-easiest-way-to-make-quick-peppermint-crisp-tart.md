Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
