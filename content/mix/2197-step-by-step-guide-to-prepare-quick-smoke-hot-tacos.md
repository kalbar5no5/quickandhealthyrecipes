Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
