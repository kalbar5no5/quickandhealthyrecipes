Spatula - I found it easier to mix this dough with a spatula versus a spoon. You can easily get all of the flour into the mix this way. I combine oreo cookies, nutella and melted chocolate to make super rich Nutella Truffles. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
