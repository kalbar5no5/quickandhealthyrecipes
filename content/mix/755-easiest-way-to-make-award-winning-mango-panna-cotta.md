Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
