Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
