Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
