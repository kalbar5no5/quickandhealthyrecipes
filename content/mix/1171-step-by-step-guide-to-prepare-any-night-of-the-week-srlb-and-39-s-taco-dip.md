Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
