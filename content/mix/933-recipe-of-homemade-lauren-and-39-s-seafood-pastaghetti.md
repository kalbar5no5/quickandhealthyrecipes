Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
