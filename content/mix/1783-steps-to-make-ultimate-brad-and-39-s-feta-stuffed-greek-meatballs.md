My little Feta Stuffed Greek Style Meatballs a perfect make-ahead appetizer that keeps me out of the kitchen and front and center with my guests. They are made with both ground pork and ground beef. I stuff them full of feta cheese crumbles that I buy at my local market. I am not a fan of using the pre-packaged feta crumbles because I think a big block of feta, that you break apart yourself. The meatballs are super easy to make, simply put all the ingredients, bar the feta, into a bowl and mix together with a fork. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
