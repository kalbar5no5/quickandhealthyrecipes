Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
