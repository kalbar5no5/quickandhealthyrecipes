Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!
