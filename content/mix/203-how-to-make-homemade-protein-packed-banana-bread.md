Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
