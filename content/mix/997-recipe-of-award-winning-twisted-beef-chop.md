Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
