Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
