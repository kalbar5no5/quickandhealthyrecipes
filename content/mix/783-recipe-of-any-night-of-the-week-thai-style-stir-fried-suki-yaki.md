Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
