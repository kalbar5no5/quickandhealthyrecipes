Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
