Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true.

The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood.

The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine.
