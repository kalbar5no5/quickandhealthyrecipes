- "The cooking time is 30 seconds for each side. If they are done or darkened before that, your oil is too hot. If they are not a golden brown color your oil temperature is too low."

- "They&#39;re also delicious topped with chocolate syrup or maple syrup."
- "If they have cooled, you can heat them up in a toaster oven for 2 minutes. After that, let them sit for 2 minutes. The middle will be soft and the glaze will be crispy and soft."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
