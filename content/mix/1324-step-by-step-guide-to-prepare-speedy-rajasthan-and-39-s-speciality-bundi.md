Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
