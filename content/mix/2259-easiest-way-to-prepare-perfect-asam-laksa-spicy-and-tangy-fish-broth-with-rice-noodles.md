How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
