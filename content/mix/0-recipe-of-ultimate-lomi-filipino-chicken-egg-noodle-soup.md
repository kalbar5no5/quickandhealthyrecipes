Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
