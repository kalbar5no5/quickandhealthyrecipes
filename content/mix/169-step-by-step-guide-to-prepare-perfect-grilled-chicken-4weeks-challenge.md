You can put grilled chicken in just about anything: sliced on top of salads, stuffed into sandwiches, shredded for chicken soups or skewered on a kabob. Grilled chicken breasts can be the epitome of boring. Too often they&#39;re dried out or rubbery. But when soaked in a super-quick marinade — with balsamic, brown sugar, and dried thyme — you&#39;re. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are marinated in olive oil, oregano, salt, pepper, and lemon juice, and then grilled to perfection in this Mediterranean chicken salad recipe. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
