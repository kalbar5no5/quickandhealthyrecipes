Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
