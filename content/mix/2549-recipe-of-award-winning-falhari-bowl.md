Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
