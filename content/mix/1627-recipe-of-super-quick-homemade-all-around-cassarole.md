Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
