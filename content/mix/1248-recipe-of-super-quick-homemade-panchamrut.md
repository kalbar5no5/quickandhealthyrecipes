How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
