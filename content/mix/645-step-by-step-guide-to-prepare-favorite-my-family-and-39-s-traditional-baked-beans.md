Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
