Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
