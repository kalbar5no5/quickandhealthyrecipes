Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
