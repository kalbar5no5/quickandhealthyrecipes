Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
