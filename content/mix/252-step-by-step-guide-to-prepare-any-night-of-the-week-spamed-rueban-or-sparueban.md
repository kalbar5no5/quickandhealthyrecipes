Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest.
