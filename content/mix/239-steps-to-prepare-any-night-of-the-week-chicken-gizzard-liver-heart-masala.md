Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
