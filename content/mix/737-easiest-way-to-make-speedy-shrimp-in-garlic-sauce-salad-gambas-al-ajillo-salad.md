How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
