Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
