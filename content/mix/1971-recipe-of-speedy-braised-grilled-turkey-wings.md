Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
