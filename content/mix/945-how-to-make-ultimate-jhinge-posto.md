Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
