They&#39;re mighty delicious and dare I say better than a sweet waffle! While I definitely enjoy a sweet waffle with butter and maple syrup, I like savory. falafel waffle - The Falafel Waffle is a vegan breakfast dish taken from the &#39;Will It Waffle?&#39; cookbook. This no-grain morning meal appeals to the glute. Who said that waffles are for breakfast only? With spinach, peppers, basil, and scallions tucked in every inch of these waffles, you will want to eat them for I just acquired a Belgian waffle iron from my sister (score!), so naturally, the only way to cure my breakfast blues is to make some waffles for dinner. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
