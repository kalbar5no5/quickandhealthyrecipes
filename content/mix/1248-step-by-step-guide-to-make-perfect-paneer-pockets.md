Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
