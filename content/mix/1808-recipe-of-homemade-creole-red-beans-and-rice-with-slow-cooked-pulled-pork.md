Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
