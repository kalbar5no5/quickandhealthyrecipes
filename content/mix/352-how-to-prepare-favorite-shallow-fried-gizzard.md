Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
