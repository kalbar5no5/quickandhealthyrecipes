Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
