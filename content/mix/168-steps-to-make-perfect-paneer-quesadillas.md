Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
