How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
