How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
