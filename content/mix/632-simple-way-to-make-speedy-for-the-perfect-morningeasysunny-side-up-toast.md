Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
