Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
