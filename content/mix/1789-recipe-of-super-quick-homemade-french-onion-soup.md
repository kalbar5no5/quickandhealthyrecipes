Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
