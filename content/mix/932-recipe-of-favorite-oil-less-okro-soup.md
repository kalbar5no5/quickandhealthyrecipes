Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine.
