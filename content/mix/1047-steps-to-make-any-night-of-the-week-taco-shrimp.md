Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
