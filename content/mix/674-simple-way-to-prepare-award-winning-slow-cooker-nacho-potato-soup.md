Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
