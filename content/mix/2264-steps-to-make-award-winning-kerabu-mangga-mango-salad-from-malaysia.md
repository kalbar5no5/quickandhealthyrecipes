Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
