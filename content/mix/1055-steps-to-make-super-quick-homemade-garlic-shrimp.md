Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
