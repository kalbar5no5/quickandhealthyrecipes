Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
