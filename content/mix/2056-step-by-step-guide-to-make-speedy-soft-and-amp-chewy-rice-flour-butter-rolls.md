Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
