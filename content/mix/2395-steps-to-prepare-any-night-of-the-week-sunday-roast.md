Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
