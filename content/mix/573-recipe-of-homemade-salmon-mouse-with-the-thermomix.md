Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
