Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
