Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
