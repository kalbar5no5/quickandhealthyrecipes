It&#39;s &#34;crab&#34; and corn soup for people with crab allergy. Basically, Oden is a Japanese soup made by filling a simmering pot with a dashi soup stock and various ingredients such as daikon (Japanese radish), boiled egg, multiple types of fish cakes, and konnyaku (yam cake). The oden ingredients are simmered in the pot for hours, or even days, and when you bite into the ingredients your mouth will be filled with the juicy flavorful soup. This clear broth seasoned with soy sauce seems very simplistic, but it belies the intense umami flavor within the soup.

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
