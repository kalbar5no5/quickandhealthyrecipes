Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
