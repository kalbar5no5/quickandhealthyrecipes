In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, add the longanisas and pour the water. Using a fork, prick each of the sausages once or twice - this is so the water absorbs and the longanisas tenderize while cooking.

As sausages go, this one is a very simple one, although recipes vary from country to country, even from one sausage-maker to another. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
