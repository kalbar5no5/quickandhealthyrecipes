It&#39;s the perfect way to use up St. If you asked me what my favorite deli sandwich is I&#39;d probably have to think long and hard between a hot pastrami on rye (class NYC right there) or a Reuben. Create slurry by whisking cornstarch and cold water together in a small bowl. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
