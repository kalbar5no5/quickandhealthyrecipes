Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
