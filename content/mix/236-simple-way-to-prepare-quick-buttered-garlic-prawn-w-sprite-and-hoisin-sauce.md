How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
