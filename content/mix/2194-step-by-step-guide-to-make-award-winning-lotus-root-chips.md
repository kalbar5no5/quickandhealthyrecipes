Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
