Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
