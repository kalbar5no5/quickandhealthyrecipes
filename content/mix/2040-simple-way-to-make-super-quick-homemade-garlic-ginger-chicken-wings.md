Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
