Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
