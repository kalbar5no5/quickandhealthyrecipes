Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
