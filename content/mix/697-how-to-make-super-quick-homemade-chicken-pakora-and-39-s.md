These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process.
