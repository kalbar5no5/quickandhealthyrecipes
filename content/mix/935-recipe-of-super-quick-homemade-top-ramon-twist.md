Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
