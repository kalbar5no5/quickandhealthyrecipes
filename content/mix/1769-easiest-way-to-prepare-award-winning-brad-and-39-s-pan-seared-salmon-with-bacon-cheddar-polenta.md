Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
