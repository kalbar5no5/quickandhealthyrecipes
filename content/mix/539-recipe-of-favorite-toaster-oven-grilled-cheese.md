Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
