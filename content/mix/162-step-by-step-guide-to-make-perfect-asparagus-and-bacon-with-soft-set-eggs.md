Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
