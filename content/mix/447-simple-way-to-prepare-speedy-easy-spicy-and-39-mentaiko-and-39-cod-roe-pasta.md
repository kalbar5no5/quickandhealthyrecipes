Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
