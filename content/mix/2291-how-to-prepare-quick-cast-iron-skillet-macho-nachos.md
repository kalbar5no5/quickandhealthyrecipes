Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
