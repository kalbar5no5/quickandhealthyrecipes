Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!
