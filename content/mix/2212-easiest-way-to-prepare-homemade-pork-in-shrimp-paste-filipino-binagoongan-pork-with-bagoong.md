Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
