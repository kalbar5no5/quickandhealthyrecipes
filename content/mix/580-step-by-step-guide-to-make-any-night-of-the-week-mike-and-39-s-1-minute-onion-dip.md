Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
