Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood.

The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine.
