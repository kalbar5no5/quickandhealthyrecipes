Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
