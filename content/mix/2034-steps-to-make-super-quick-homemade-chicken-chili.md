Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
