Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood.

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.
