Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
