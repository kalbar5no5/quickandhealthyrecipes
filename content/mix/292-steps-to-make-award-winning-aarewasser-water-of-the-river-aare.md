Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
