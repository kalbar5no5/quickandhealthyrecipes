Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
