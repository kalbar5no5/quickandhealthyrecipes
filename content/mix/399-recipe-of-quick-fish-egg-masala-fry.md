Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
