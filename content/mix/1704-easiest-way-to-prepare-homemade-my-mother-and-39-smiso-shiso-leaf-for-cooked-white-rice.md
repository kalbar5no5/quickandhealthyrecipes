Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
