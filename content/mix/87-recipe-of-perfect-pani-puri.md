Potato, onion, chickpeas, coriander chutney stuffed crispy puri drenched in sour and spicy mint flavored water (pudina pani) easily fills one&#39;s mouth and takes taste buds on a journey of heaven and it is no wonder that it&#39;s a popular street snack along the length and breadth of India and known as gol gappa, puchka, pakodi, Pani Puri, etc. Preparing pudina vala pani and masala for panipuri at home is not only a healthier way of enjoying it but also allows you to customize it the way you like it. The pani puri water is what binds all the components together and makes the filling-filled puris such a fun experience! I make my version of jaljeera with a host of spices and seasonings that boost the flavour of the pani. It is all about getting the balance right for a sweet, spicy, tangy, and sour pani. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
