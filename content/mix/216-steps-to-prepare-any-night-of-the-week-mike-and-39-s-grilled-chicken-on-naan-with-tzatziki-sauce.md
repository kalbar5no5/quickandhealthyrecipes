Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
