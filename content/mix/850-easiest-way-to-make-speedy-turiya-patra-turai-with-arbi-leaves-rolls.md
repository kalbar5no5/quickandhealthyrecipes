Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
