Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
