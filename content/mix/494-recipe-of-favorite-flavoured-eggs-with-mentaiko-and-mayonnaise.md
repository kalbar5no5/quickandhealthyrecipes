Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!
