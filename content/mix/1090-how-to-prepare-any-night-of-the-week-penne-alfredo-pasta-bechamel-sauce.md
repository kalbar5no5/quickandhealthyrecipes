Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
