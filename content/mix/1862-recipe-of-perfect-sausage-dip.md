Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
