Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
