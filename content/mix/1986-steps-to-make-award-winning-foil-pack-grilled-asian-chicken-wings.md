Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
