Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
