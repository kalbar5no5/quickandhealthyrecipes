Alternatively, if you want to make the toasts in a stove, place a heavy bottomed pan on low flame and place the bread slices in the pan. By this time the breads also get toast properly. Try sourdough for a tangy flavor, or an airy bread like ciabatta if you like the cheese oozing through the holes and burning on the pan. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
