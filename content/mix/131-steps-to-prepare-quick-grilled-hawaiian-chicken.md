How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
