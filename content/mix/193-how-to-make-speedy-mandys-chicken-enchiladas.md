Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
