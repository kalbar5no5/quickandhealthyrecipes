Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
