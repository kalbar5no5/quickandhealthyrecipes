Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
