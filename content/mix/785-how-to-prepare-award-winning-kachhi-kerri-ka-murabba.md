Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
