Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
