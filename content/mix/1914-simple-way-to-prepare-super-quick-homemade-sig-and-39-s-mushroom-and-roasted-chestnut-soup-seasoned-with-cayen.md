Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
