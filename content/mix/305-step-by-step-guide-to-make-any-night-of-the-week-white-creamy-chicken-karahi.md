Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
