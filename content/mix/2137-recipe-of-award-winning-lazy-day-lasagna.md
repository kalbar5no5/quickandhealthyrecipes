Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
