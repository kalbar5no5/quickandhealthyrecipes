Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
