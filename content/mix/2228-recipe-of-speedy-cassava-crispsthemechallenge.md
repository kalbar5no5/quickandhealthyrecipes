Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
