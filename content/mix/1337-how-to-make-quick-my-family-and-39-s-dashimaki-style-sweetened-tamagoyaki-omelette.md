Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
