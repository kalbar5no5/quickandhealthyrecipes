Wings are one of the things you absolutely have to have at any football game or party with friends (like New Year&#39;s Eve parties). Attach candy thermometer so it&#39;s in the oil, but not touching the pot. Fried chicken wings also go well with Asian-inspired sauces such as curry, soy glaze, and Thai. To make a curry sauce, just buy green curry paste and toss it into the fried wings. For soy glaze, just add soy sauce, brown sugar, a bit of water, rice vinegar, white wine vinegar, and ground ginger into a pan. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
