How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
