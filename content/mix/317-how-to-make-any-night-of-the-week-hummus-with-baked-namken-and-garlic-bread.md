Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
