recipeinstructions:

- "Spray the inside of a 5 quart crock pot with nonstick cooking spray. Break apart hash brown shreds in package. Dump hash browns and sausage into crock pot. Don&#39;t worry about stirring yet."
- "In a large bowl beat eggs together with milk, salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried mustard until completely combined."

Up to 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for even more heat if you&#39;re feeling adventurous. I like to cook the onion with the sausage. Just add bell pepper and jalape単o when you dump in the hash browns and sausage, add cayenne to the eggs. If you want to... Wrap it up in a flour tortilla with some salsa and sour cream and you&#39;ve got a breakfast burrito on-the-go! ;-) With all the extra liquid from the veggies it may need the full 8 hours so it&#39;s not too wet or potentially mushy."

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
