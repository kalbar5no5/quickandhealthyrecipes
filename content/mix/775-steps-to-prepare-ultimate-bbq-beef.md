- "I will usually use a pound of beef to a half bottle of Heinz chili sauce. You can vary the recipe to your taste. I will cook it sometimes at 300 degrees for a longer time to make the beef very tender."

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
