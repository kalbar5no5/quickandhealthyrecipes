Bananas are one of the most frequent purchases I make at the grocery store because my whole family loves them. (Like this banana bread, these healthy chocolate banana muffins, this banana cake, or these banana crumb muffins). Banana Muffins taste like banana bread with a sweet cinnamon &amp; butter topping. All you need is one bowl. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
