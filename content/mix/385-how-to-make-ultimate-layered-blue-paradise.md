Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
