Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
