Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
