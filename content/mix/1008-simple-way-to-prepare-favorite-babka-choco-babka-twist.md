Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
