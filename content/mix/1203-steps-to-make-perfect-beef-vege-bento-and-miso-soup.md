Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
