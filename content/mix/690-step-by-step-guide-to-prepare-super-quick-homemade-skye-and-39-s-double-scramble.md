Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!
