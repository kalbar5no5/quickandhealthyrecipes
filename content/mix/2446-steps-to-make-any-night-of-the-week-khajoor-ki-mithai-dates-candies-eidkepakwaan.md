Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
