Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
