Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
