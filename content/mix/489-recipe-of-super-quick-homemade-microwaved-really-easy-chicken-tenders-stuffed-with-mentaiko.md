Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
