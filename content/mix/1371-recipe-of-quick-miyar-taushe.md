Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
