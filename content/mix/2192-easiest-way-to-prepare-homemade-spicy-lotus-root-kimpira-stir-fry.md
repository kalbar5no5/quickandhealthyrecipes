Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
