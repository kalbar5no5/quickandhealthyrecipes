Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
