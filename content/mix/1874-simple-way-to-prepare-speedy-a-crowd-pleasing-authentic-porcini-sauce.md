Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
