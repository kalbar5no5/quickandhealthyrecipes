Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
