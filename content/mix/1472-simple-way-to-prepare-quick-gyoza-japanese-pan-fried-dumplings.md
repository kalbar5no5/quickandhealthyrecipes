Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
