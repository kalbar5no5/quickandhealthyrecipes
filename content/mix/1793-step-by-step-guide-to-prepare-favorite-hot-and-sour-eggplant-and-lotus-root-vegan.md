Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
