Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
