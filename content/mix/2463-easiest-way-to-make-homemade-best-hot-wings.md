Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
