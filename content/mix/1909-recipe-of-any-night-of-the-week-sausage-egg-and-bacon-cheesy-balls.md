How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
