In my opinion, the best chili recipe is a base of ground beef, tomato, spices, and BEANS. I love the number of fiber beans add to this dish and I promise you won&#39;t regret adding them. Chili without Beans is full of beef, peppers, tomatoes, and spices—it&#39;s so flavorful and just right for game day or a chilly night at home! There&#39;s perhaps no other single food group that is more Texan than chili, and over the years we&#39;ve tested many recipes and talked to many Tex-perts on what constitutes a real big bowl of red.

Chili without Beans is full of beef, peppers, tomatoes, and spices—it&#39;s so flavorful and just right for game day or a chilly night at home! There&#39;s perhaps no other single food group that is more Texan than chili, and over the years we&#39;ve tested many recipes and talked to many Tex-perts on what constitutes a real big bowl of red. There&#39;s a saying in Texas: &#34;If you know beans about chili, you know chili ain&#39;t got no beans.&#34; In Texas, &#34;chili&#34; is shorthand for chile con carne, which translates to &#34;chile peppers with meat.&#34; No beans in sight. Most people think that chili can trace its origins to Mexico, but it&#39;s actually an authentically Texan dish. The ICS defines traditional red and green chili as &#34;any kind of meat or combination of meats, cooked with red chili peppers, various spices and other ingredients, with the exception of beans and pasta which are strictly forbidden. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
