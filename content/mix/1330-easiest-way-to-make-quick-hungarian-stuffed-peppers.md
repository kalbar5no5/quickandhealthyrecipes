Two common ingredients in Hungarian cuisine are paprika spice and tomato sauce and they are what put a Hungarian spin on this version of stuffed peppers known as toltott paprika. It definitely wouldn&#39;t be Hungarian without the ever-present, but optional, garnish of sour cream. This sounds like a bland version of a traditional Hungarian dish. We use Hungarian peppers which have a mild flesh but HOT seeds and fiber.  I recommend these peppers because bell peppers often have a bitter aftertaste Scraping out the seeds and most fiber gives the dish some tang.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
