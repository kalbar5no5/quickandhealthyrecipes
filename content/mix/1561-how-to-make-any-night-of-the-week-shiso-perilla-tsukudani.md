Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
