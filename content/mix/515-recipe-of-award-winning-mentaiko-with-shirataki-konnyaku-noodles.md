Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
