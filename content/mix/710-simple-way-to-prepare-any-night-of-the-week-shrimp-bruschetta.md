Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
