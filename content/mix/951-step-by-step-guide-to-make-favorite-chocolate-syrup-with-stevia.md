Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
