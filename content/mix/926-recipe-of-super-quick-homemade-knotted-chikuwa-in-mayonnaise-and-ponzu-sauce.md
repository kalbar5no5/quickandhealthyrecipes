Mayonnaise is one of the most popular condiments out there. In reality, it&#39;s a cold emulsified sauce, and while it&#39;s easy to make in a blender, whisking by hand yields slightly different results: a mayo that&#39;s silkier, saucier, and more luxurious. This may look like soy sauce, and it is made from soy sauce but is far from being that. Ponzu is thin, citrusy and tastes great with a variety of foods like salad or meat.
