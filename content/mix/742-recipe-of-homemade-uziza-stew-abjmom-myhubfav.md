Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
