Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
