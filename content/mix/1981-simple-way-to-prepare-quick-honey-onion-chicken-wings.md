Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
