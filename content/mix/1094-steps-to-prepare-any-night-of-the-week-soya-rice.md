Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
