Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
