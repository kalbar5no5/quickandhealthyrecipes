Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
