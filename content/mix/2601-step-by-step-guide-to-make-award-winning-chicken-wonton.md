Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
