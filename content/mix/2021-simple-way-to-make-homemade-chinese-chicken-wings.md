Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
