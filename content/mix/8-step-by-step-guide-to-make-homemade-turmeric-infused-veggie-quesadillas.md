Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
