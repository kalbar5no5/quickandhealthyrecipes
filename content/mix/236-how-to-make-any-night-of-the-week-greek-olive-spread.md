Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
