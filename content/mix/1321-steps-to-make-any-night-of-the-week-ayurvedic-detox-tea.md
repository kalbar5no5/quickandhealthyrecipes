Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
