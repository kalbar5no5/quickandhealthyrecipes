How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
