Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
