Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a special dish, golgappa papri. One of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Golgappa Papri is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It's easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions every day. They are nice and they look fantastic. Golgappa Papri is something which I have loved my whole life.

Golgappa Puri, a round shaped small crispy puri that is small enough to easily fit in your mouth, is a basic ingredient in many chaat recipes like pani puri, dahi puri etc. The golgappa pani or spicy water is made of mint leaves in some places and in some places its jaljeera pani or hing pani or amchur (dried mango) pani. The meetha pani is the usual sweet tamarind chutney. In this post I have shared jaljeera made from mint leaves and spices.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have golgappa papri using 13 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you cook it.

For the stuffing, you can use your choice of fillings. I still remember having Papdi chaat for the first time in a Punjabi restaurant in Mumbai (can&#39;t remember the restaurant&#39;s name). It was one of the best papdi chaat I had in Mumbai. When living in Delhi, I had papri chaat often, but cannot forget the one I had in Mumbai. Being a true blue Mumbaite, I have always made Sev puri, Pani puri, Bhel puri, Dahi puri at home, but never papri chaat. 

Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
