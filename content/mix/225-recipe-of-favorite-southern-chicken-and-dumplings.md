- "3 carrots cut into large pieces"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "1 large sprig each of thyme and parsley"
- "1/4 tsp kosher salt to taste"

- "3 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "3/4 tsp salt"
- "4 1/2 tbsp of butter"
- "1 cup whole milk or buttermilk can use water as well"
recipeinstructions:
- "To prepare chicken and broth, place all ingredients for base in a large dutch oven or stock pot. Bring almost to a boil, lower heat, cover partially and gently simmer until chicken is tender, about 2 hours."
- "While chicken is cooking about 30 mins before chicken is done prepare the dumplings. To make the dumplings, mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture with your fingertips until it looks crumbly . Make a well in center, pour in milk, buttermilk, or water 1/4 cup at a time and stir until a ball of dough forms."

- "Strain chicken broth through a fine mesh sieve (preferably lined with cheese cloth), discarding vegetables. Skim excess fat from the surface. One way to do this is to put the cooled broth in the refrigerator for a half hour which solidifies the excess fat for easier removal."
- "Roll out dough ball on a floured surface, rolling it flat, and rolling about a 1/4 inch thick. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut dough into rectangles about 1 inch wide by 3 inches long. These are your dumplings."
- "To finish broth, melt butter in dutch oven or stock pot used. Add onion and saute over medium heat until onion is beginning to color, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute 30 seconds. Add 1 tablespoon chopped parsley and broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium."
- "Drop dumplings into gently simmering broth, a quarter of them at a time, stirring to make sure they don&#39;t stick together. Cover and allow to cook for 6-7 minutes."
- "Reduce heat to low and add de-boned chicken. Allow to cook until thickened, approximately 15-20 minutes, or longer. Taste and adjust seasonings to liking. Ladle into a large bowl or individual soup plates and sprinkle with remaining parsley."

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
