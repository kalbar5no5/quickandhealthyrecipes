Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
