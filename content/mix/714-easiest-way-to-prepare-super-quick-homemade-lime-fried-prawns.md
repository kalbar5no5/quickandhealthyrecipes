Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
