Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
