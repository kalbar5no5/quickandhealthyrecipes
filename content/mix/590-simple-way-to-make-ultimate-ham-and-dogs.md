Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
