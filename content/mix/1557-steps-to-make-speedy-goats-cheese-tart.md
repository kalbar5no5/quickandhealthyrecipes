Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
