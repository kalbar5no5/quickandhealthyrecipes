Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
