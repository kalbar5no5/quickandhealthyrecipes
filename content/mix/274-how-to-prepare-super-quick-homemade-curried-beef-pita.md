Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
