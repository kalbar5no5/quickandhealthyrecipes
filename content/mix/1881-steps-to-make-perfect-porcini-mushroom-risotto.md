Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
