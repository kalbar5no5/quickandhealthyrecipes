Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
