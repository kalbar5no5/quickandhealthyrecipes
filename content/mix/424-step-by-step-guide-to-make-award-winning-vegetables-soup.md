Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
