How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!
