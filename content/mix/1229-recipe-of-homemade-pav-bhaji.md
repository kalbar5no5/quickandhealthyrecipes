Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
