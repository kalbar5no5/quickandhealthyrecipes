Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
