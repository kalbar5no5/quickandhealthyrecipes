Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
