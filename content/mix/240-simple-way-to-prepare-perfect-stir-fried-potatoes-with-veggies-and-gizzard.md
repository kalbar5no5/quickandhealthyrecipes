Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
