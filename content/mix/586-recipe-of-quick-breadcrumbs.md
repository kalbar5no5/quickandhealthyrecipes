Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
