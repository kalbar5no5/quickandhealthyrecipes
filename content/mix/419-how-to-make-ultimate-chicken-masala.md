Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
