Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
