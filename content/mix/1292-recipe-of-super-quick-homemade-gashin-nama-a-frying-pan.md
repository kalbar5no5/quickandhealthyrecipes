A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true.

The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.
