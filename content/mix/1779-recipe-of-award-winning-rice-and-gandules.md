Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body.
