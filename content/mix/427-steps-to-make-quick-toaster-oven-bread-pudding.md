Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
