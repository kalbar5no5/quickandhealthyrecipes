Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
