Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
