Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
