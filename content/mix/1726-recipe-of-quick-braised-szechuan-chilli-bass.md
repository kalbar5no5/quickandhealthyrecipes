Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
