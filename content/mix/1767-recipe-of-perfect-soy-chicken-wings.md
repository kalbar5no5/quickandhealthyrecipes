Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
