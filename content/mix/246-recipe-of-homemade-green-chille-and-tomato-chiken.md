Hey everyone, it's Drew, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, green chille and tomato chiken. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Green chille and tomato chiken is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look wonderful. Green chille and tomato chiken is something which I've loved my entire life.

Jab tak chiken ka pani achy sy dary na ho Jay. This is one of me and my Mom favorite, if you want more spicy you can add it with Thai chili or chili bird eye. You can taste the cooked bitterness of green chili and the sourness of green tomato with smell of a fresh and fragrant hot basil. Make this easier version of chili verde using chicken and a tomatillo-based green salsa instead of roasting and pureeing fresh tomatillos.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have green chille and tomato chiken using 8 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

Dunking the lavash under the mixture so it&#39;s covered. In New Mexico, this is served with either red chile sauce (not the same thing as salsa--much hotter) or salsa verde (made with Hatch chilies, tomatillos, and cilantro). Recipes for those were included in the same issue of Cooking Light as this green chile chicken casserole recipe, as was a recipe for posole. Stir in the beans, sour cream and cilantro; heat through.

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
