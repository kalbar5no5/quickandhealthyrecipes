Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
