Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
