Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
