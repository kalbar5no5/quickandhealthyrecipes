How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
