Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
