Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
