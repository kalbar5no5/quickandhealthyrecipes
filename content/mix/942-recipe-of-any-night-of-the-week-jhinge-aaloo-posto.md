Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
