Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
