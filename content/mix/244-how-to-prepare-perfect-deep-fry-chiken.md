Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
