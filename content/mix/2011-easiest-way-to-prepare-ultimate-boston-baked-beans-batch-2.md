Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
