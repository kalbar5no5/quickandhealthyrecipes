Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
