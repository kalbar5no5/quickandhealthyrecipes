Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
