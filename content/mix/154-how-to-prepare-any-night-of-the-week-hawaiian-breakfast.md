Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
