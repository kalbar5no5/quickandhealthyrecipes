Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
