How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
