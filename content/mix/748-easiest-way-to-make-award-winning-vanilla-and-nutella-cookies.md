Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
