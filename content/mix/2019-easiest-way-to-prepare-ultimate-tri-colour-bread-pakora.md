Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
