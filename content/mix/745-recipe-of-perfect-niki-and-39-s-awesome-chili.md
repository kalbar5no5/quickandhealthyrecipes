Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
