Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
