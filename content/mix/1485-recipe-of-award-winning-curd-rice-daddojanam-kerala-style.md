Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
