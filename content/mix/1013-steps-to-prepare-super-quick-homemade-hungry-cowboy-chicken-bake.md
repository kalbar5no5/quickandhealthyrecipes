Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
