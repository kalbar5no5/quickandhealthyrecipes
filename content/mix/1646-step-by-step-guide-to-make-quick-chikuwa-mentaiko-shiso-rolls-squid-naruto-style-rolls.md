Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
