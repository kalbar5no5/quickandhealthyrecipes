Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.
