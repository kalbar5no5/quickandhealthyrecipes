How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
