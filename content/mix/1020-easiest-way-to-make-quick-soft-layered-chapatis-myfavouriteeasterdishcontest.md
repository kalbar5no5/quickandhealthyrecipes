Hi guys, After the numerous requests on how to make soft layered chapatis I have decided to post a detailed recipe and tips on how to make soft and sweet layered chapatis. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
