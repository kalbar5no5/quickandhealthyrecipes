Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
