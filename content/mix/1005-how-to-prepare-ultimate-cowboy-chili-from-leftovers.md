Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
