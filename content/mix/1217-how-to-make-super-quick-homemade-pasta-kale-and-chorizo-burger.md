Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
