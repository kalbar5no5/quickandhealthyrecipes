Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
