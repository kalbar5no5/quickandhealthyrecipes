Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
