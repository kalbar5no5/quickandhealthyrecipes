Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
