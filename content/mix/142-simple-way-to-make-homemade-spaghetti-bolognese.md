Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
