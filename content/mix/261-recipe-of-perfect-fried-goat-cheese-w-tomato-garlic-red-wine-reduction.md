Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
