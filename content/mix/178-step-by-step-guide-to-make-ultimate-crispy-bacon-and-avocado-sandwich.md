Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
