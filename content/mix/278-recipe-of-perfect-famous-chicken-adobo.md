Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
