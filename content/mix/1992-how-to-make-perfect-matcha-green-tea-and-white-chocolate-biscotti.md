Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
