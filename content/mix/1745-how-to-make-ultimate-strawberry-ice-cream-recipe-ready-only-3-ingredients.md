Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
