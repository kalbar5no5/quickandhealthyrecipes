Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
