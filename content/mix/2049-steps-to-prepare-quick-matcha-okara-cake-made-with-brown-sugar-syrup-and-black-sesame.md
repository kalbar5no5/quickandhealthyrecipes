Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
