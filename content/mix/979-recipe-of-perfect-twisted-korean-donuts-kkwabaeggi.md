Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
