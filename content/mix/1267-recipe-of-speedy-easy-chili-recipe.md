Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
