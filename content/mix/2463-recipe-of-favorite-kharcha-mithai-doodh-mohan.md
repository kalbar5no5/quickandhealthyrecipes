Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
