Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
