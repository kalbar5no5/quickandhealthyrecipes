Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
