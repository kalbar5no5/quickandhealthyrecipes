Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
