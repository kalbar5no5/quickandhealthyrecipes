Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
