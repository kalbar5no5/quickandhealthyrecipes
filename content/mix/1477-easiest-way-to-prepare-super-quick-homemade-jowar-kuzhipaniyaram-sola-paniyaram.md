Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
