Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
