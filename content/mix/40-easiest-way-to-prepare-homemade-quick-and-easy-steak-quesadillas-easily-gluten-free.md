- "1 box thin steak meat example SteakUmm"
- "1 large onion thickly sliced"
- "1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese or more if desired"
- " cilantro"
- "8 small corn tortillas I used Guerrero 5 inch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the steak meat in a big skillet. (Steak-Umms and similar products are cooked from frozen.) Keep them spread out so they can cook evenly and try to keep them as flat as possible. You will need to cook these a few at a time. When they are cooked on both sides, move the steak to a plate and keep warm."
- "Saute the onion slices in the grease from the steak meat. Add additional oil, if necessary. When the onions are done, move them to a bowl and keep warm."
- "Spray skillet with oil, if necessary."
- "Place 2 tortillas in the skillet. Top with about 1/8 of the cheese on each tortilla."
- "Layer with about 1/4 of the steak meat and onions. Sprinkle with some cilantro. Top with about 1/8 of cheese again and then add another tortilla."
- "Gently press down on the quesadillas a bit to flatten."
- "When the bottom tortilla is lightly browned, gently flip the quesadillas over. Brown on the second side."
- "When they are browned and the cheese is melted, move them to a plate and keep warm. They are best when they are slightly crispy and no longer limp."
- "Repeat with the remaining ingredients."
- "Cut each quesadilla with a pizza cutter and serve."
- "Notes: You can serve with salsa, but ours were great without it and more like cheese steak this way. If you want them cheesier, you can use up to 2 cups of cheese. ~~ Yields: 4 Small Quesadillas"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
