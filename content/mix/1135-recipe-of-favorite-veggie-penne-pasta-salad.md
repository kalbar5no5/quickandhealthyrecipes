Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
