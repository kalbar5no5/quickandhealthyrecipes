Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!
