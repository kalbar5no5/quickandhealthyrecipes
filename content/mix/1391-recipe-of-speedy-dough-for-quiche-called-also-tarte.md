Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
