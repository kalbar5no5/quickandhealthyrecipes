Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
