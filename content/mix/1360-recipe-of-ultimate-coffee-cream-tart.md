Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
