Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
