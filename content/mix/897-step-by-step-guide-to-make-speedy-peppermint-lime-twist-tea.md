Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
