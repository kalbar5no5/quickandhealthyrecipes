Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
