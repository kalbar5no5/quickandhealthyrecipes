Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
