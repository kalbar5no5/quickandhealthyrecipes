Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
