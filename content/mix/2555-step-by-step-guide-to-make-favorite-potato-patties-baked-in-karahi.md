How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
