Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
