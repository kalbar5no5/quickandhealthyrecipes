Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
