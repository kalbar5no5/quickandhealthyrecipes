How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
