How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
