Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
