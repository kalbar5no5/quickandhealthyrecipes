Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
