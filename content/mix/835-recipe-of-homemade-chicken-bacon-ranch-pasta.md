Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
