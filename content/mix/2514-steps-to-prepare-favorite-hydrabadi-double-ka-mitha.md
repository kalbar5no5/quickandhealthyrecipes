How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
