Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
