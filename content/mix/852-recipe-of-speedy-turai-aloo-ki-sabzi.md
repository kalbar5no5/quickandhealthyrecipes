Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
