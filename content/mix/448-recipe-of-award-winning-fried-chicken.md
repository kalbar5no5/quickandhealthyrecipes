Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
