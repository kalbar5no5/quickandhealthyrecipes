Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
