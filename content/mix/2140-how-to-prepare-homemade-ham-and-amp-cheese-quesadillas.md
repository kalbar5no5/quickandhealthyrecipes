Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
