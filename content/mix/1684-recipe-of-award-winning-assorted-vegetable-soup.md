Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
