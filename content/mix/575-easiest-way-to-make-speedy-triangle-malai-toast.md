Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
