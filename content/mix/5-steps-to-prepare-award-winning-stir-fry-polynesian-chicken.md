Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
