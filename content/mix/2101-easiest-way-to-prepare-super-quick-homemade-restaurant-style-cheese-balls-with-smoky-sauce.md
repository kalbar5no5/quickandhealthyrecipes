Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
