recipeinstructions:
- "Pour the porcini stock into a small pan (leave the bottom bit as it will be full of settled grit from the porcini) heat it on the hob with the chicken stock cube dissolved in. Keep it hot but not boiling."

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
