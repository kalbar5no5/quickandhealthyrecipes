Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
