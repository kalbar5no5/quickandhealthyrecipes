Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
