recipeinstructions:
- "The sushi rice: Cook the rice, mix with sushi vinegar while it&#39;s still hot and set aside to let cool."
- "Prepare the additional ingredients: Either grill or microwave a piece of salted salmon to cook it through. You can put it in the rice cooker and cook it along with the rice and take it out when both are done if you like."
- "Mix the eggs and milk together, and make finely scrambled eggs (iri tamago) using just a little oil. You can cook it in a nonstick frying pan without any oil instead."
- "Using two different sized molds or bowls or cups etc. for the cake, pack with the scrambled eggs → sushi rice → nori seaweed → sushi rice → cooked flaked salmon → sushi rice, in that order."
- "Invert the two packed molds to form two layers. Place the smaller &#34;cake&#34; on the very edge of the bigger &#34;cake&#34;."
- "Decorate: Slice the daikon radish thinly, sprinkle with salt and massage it in to tenderize it. Cut a slice for the cake message and leave it to soak for a while in sushi vinegar."
- "Cut the smoked salmon into 5 to 6 cm pieces. Layer and roll them up into rose shapes. Spread out the outer &#39;petals&#39; to make them look extra-voluminous."
- "Roll the thinly sliced and salted daikon radish to make rosebuds. If the daikon radish is too thick or not squeezed out tightly enough it will be hard to roll!"
- "Microwave the snow peas, slice in half diagonally and use as &#34;leaves&#34; around the roses."
- "Make the mashed potatoes. Cook potatoes in the microwave and mash them up. Add salt, mayonnaise, milk, and a tiny bit of butter, and pass the mixture through a sieve."
- "After passing the mashed potato mixture through a sieve, add some milk so that it&#39;s the consistency of cream. Put the potato-cream in a piping bag fitted with an icing tip and decorate the cake with it."
- "Make the &#34;lace&#34; for the cake. Slice the lotus root thinly, cook in the microwave and sprinkle with salt. Put the slices around the cake."
- "Cut the quail egg face parts out of nori seaweed using scissors or a nori punch (used for bentos). Cut letters out for the daikon radish plaque. If you moisten the surface of the eggs and daikon radish slightly it&#39;s easier to stick on the nori."
- "*Add color to the quail egg faces with a little red food coloring dissolved in water or ketchup, using the tip of a toothpick. *I scattered on some salmon caviar too, but I forgot to take a photo of it."
- "*Use a clear glass plate or a plate that&#39;s not white under the sushi cake. The lotus root &#34;lace&#34; will stand out better."

Chirashi sushi is also referred to as bara sushi in Japanese, but what differentiates this layered sushi is that some might refer to it as a festive. Why don&#39;t you celebrate your anniversary with Fancy Sushi Cake and Japanese Strawberry Sweet Mochi? We make a party sushi cake decorating with Japanese fresh Seafoods &#34;SASHIMI&#34; and vegetables. And Winter is best season for strawberry in Japan, so I would like many foreign tourists to try strawberry sweet mochi in my class. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
