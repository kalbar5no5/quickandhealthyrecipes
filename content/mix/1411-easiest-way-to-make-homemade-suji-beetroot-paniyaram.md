Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
