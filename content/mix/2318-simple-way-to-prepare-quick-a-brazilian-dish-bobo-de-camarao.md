Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
