Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
