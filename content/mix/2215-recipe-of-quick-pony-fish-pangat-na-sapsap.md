Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
