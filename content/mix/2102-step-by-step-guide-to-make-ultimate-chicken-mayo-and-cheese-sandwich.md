Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
