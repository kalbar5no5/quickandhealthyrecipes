At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood.

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression.

These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
