Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
