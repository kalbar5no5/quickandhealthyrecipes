Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
