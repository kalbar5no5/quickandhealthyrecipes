Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
