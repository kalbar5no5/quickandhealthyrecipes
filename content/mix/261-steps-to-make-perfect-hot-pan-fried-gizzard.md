Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
