Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
