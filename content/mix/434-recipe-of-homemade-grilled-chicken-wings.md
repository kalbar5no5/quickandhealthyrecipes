Chicken wings are an immensely flavorful, customizable, and easy dinner idea for yourself or the whole family. While they can be cooked in the oven or deep-fried, grilling your chicken wings can add another layer of smoky deliciousness with the charring from an open flame. Bump the flame up to medium heat, place the chicken on the grill rack and cover. Keep one burner off or on low in case some wings are cooked before others. Put the wings in a single layer on the grill over the heat. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
