Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
