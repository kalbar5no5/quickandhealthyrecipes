Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
