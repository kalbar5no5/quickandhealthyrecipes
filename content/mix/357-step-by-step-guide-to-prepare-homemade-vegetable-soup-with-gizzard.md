Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
