Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
