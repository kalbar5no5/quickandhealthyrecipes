Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
