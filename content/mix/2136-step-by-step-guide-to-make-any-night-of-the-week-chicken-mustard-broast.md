Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
