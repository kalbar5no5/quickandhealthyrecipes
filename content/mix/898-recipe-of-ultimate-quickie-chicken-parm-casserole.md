Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
