Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
