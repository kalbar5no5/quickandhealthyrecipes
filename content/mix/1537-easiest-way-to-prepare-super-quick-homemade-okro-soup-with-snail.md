Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
