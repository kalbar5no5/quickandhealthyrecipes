Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
