Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
