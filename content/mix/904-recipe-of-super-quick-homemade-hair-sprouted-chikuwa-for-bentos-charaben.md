Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
