Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
