Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
