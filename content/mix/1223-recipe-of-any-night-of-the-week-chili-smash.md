Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
