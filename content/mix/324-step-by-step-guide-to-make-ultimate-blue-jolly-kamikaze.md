Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
