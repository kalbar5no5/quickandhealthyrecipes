Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
