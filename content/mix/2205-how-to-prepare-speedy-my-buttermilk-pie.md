Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
