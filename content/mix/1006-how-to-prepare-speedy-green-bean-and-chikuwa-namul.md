If you don&#39;t have gukganjang (soy sauce for soup), just add another ¼ tsp of salt. BTW, just to clarify, the bean sprouts in this Korean Bean Sprouts recipe are Mung Bean Sprouts and NOT Soy Bean Sprouts which is called Kongnamul (콩나물). Mung bean sprouts are a culinary vegetable grown by sprouting mung beans. They can be grown by placing and watering the sprouted beans in the shade until the roots grow long.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have green bean and chikuwa namul using 7 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook it.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
