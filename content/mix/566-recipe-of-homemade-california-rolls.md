Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
