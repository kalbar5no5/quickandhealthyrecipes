How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
