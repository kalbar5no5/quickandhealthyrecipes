Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
