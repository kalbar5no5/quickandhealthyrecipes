How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
