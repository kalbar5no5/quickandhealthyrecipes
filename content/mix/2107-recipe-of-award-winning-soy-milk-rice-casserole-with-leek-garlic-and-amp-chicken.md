Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
