Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
