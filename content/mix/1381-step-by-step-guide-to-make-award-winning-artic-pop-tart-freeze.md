Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
