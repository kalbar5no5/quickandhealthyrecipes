Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
