Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
