Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
