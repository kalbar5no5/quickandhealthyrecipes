Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
