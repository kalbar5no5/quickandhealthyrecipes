Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
