- "When the surface is soft set, fold it into thirds using chopsticks."
- "Push the folded egg to the far side of the pan. Spread some oil in the open space of the pan using the oil-soaked paper from Step 2. Press the bottom of the frying pan on the moistened kitchen towel again as in Step 3."
- "Pour in some beaten egg as in Step 4. Hold the rolled egg up a bit and tilt the pan to let the uncooked egg flow under it."
- "Repeat Steps 5 to 7 until all the beaten egg is used up."
- "Wrap the cooked tamagoyaki in a sushi rolling mat and leave it as-is for a while. The tamagoyaki is done. If you match up the edges of the mat to the corners of the tamgoyaki when you wrap it, the surface will have a clean spiral."

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
