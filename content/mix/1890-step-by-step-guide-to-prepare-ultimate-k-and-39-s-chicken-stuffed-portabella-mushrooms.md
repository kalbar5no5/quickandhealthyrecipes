How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
