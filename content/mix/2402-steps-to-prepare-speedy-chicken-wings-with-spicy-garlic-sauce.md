Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
