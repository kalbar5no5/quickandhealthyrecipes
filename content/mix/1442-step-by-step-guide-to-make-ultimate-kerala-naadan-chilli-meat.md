Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
