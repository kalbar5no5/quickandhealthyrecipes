Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
