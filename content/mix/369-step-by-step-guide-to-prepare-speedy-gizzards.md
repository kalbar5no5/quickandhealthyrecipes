A gizzard is a muscle found in the digestive tract of a chicken. If you&#39;ve ever seen chickens pecking away at the ground, they are in fact swallowing tiny bits of grit and gravel, which travels through the chicken&#39;s digestive tract and eventually lodges in the gizzard. The gizzard, also referred to as the ventriculus, gastric mill, and gigerium, is an organ found in the digestive tract of some animals, including archosaurs (pterosaurs, crocodiles, alligators, dinosaurs including birds), earthworms, some gastropods, some fish, and some crustaceans. Drain and chop into bite size pieces.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have gizzards using 5 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
