Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
