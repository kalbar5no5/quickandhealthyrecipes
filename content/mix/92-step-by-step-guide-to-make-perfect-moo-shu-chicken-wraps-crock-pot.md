Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
