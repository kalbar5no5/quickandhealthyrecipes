Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
