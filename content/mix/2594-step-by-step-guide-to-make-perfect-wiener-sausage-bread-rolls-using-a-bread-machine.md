Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
