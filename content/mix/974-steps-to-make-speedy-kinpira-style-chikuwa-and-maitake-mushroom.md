Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
