Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
