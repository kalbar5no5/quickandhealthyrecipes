If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins.
