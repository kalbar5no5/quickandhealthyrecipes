Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest.
