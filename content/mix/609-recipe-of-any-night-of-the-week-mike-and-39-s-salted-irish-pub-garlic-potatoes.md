recipeinstructions:
- "Using cold water, wash potatoes but do not puncture them whatsoever. Place clean spuds in enough cold water to cover the potatoes by 1&#34;+ of water and add salt. Bring water to a boil with a tight fitting lid and boil spuds for 13 - 15 minutes. Check at 13 minutes.                                                                                         Unlike potatoes that you&#39;d boil for mashed spuds dishes, you&#39;ll notice these spuds are floating. It&#39;s the large amount of salt added causing that reaction. You&#39;ll also notice that your stove top is completely flecked with millions of tiny white dots. It&#39;s the salt as well and cleans up easily."
- "Begin making your butter sauce by adding everything in that specific category and placing on low flame and slowly simmering."
- "Check one potato at 13 minutes for tenderness. You&#39;ll want these as soft and creamy as a baked spud in the center but NOT soggy. Discard that pierced potato, otherwise, it&#39;ll absorb all of the salt in the water and will be inedible."
- "Drain spuds momentarily in sink and allow to quickly dry. Almost instantly their skins will morph into a dried, white, salted coating. Place those hot spuds evenly in serving bowls."
- "Equally pour butter sauce into 4 small Ramekin bowls. Here&#39;s a tip though: A LITTLE BUTTER SAUCE GOES A VERY LONG WAY! So, don&#39;t worry about adding smaller amounts to your Ramekin dishes. :0) Then, lightly drizzle your remaining butter sauce over your plated potatoes. Following that step, garnish your spuds with a light dusting of onion powder, course sea salt, fresh chives, fresh parsley if you have it &amp; grated parmesean cheese. Offer a few toothpicks at serving and always offer an optional side dish of sour cream garnished with chives."
- "Serve with an ice cold Guiness Beer that&#39;s sat properly for at least 2 minutes once poured, before serving it in an ice cold mug as well! This is Irish pub food at its finest and most basic folks! Enjoy!"

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
