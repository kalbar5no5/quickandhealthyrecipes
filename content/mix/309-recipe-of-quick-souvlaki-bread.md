Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
