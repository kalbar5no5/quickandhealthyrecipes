Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
