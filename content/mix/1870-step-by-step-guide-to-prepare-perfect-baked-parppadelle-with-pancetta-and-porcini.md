Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
