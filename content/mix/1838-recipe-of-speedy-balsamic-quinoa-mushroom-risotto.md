Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
