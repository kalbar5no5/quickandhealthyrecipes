I would really like to make this, but I am not sure what chili beans are. Sent by Ellen Editor: Chili beans are something you&#39;ll find in the canned good aisle at your grocery store. I believe they are usually pinto beans in a mild chili-spiked sauce. If you can&#39;t find chili beans, you can likely just substitute pinto beans. The can I found at the grocery store has chemicals I am not allowed to eat. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
