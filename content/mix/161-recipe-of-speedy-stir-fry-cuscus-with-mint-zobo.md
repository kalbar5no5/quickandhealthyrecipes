Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
