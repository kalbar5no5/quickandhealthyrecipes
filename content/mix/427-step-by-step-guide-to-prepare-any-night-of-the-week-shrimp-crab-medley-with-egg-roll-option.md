Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
