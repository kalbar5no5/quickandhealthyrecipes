Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
