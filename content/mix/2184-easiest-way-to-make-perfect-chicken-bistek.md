Chicken Bistek An adaptation of the Spanish encebollado, the Filipino bistek is a dish made of sliced beef braised in a mixture of calamansi juice, soy sauce, garlic, and onions. Chicken bistek is another variation of the well known traditional beef bistek. I think this is the healthier version of bistek compared to beef or pork and it also needs less time to cook. The way to describe this dish is meat marinated in soy sauce, calamansi juice and pepper.

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
