Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
