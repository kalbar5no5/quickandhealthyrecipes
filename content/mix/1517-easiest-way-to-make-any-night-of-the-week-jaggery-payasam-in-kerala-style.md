Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
