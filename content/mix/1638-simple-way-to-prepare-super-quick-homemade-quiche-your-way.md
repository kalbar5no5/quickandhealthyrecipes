Whisk the eggs in a large bowl and add the milk and half-and-half or cream. Whisk together thoroughly and then stir in the shredded cheese and herbs. The best way to make a quiche is to add the eggs to a large measuring cup, then add the cream or milk. A quiche is a tart made with pie crust and a creamy, savory custard filling. The simplest version calls for eggs, heavy cream, whole milk, salt, and pepper, but quiche often stars cheese (we&#39;re fans of cooking with sharp Swiss and cheddar cheese), meat, and all kinds of vegetables. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
