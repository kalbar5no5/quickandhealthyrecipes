Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
