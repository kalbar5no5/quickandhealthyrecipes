Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
