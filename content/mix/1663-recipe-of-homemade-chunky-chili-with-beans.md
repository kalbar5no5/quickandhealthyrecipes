Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
