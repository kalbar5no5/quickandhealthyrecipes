recipeingredient:
- " for the batter"
- "55 g x plain flour"
- "1 x medium egg"
- "140 ml x milk"
- "5 g x melted butter"
- "100 g x smoked salmon"
- "100 g x creme fraich or cream cheese"
- "1 x small jar of fish roe or caviar opt"
- "1/2 packet dill"
recipeinstructions:
- "Beat the egg, then whisk in the flour, when that is smooth add the milk. It is easier to add 1/3 of the milk and whisk smooth then add the rest."
- "Decant batter into a jug, then remember that you forgot to add the melted butter. So melt the butter in a crepe or non stick frying pan and add it to the batter. Put the batter in the fridge for 30 minutes or more to thicken slightly."
- "Add a tiny amount of oil to the pan and wipe with kitchen paper, Start making pancakes / crepes. These need to be thin but not so thin that they cannot hold the smoked salmon filling. It&#39;s trial and error, the good news is any that don&#39;t work out are just lovely with some syrup."
- "When your on a roll with your pancakes it should be easy, flip them with a pallet knife or toss them if you like. when both sides are golden stack them on a plate. When all done and cooled down you can cover and store in the fridge if your making them in advance."
- "Slice the dill with a sharp knife, and beat it into the creme fraiche, if you want your pancakes to be easier to roll and handle you may prefer cream cheese which is firmer?"
- "Decide which side of the pancake you want to be the presentation side and sit that face down, then spread a couple of tsp of the dill cream mixture over it but not quite to the edges."
- "Tear smoked salmon into small pieces and arrange them over the pancake, then if using fish roe (the jar I bought was about £5) spoon a small row towards the lower end closest to you."
- "Lift up the edge closest to you and encase it over the caviar, then keep rolling it up like a cigar. Sit the pancake on some cling film and roll up."
- "Twist the cling film at the ends to tighten it up and for extra security you can double wrap. Now store in the fridge until just a few minutes before you serve these canapés They will be fine for up to 24 hours before the pancakes start to get soggy."
- "Unwrap the pancake then just trim of the ends with the sharpest knife you have, I cut mine into six pieces, so I started by slicing into 3 even sized peieces."
- "Slice each 3rd on a diagonal but take care to leave at least 1/2 cm gap at the edge so that the pancake doesn&#39;t unravel. I arranged mine on a slate and topped with dill sprigs. Again the creme fraiche makes these very soft so when cutting use a really sharp knife and don&#39;t be heavy handed, cream cheese will be firmer and easier to cut."
- "I served mine with a couple of other lovely canapés check out the video if you like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3U2V-KFHk0&amp;t=5s"

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
