How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
