Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
