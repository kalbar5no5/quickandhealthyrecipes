Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
