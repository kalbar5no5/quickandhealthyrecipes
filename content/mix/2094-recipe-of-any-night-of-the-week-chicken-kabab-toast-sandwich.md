Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
