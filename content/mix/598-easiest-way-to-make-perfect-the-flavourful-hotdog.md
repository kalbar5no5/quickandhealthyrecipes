Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
