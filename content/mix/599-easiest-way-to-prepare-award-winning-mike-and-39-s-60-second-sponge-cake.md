- "Spray your ramakins with an olive oil or butter spray."
- "° Fill ramakins 1/2 way to their tops.           ° Cover ramakins tightly with cling wrap.                                                                    ° Poke 4 holes in the cling wrap with a toothpick."
- "° One ramakin at a time - microwave each cake for 55 to 60 seconds. ° Check at 50 seconds on your first try. ° 55 seconds consistently does the trick for me in a newer 1100 watt microwave."
- "° While sponge cake is still warm, using the blade of a butter knife - gently pull cake from your ramakins sides.                                                                                                                                                   ° Turn ramakins over and gently release your cakes on to a plate and allow them to cool covered with cling wrap.

- "Break these cakes up in pieces or dish your cakes up any way YOU desire. Get creative!"
- "° You can use a self rising flour but know it will create a smoother cake finish [see last photo below] than the AP flour would. It&#39;s the AP flour that gives this cake it&#39;s spongy look. However, the absorbency and sweet taste are ultimately identical with self rising.                                                                                                                                                                                       ° If choosing to use a larger ramakin as pictured below, you&#39;ll need to microwave for about 90 seconds + until cake is done."

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
