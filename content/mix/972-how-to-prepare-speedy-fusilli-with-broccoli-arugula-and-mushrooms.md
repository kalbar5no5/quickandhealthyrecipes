How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!
