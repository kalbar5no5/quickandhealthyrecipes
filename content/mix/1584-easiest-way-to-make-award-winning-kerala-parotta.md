Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
