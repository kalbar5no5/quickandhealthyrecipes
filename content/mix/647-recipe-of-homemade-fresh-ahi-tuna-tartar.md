Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
