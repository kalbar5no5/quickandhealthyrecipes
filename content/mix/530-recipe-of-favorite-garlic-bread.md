Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
