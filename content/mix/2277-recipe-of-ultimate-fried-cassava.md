How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
