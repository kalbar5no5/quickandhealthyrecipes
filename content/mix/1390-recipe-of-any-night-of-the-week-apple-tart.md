Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
