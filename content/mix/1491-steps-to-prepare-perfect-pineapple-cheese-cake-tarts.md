Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
