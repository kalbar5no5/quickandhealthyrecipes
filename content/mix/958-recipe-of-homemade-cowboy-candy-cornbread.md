Cornbread is great with chili, and this Cowboy Cornbread is extra-good because it&#39;s meaty, it&#39;s cheesy, and green chilis and jalapeños give it a little kick! A great low budget meal that tastes awesome. The mix of savory cream cheese with the sweet jam-like flavor profile of cowboy candy is similar to the mix of flavors from pepper jam and cream cheese, which is a popular pairing.

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
