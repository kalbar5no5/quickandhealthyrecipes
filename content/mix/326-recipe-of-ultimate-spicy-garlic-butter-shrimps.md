Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
