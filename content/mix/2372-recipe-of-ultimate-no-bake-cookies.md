Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
