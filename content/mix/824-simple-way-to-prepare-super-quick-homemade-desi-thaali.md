Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
