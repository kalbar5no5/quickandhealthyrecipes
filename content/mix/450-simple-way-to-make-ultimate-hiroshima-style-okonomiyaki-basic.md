- "1/2 teaspoon aonori dried powdered seaweed"
- "1/2 teaspoon dried bonito optional"
- "1/2 teaspoon red pickled ginger optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare all the ingredients."
- "Here are the ingredients used in this recipe. From the left: Kelp dashi powder, dried kelp (Ground kelp can be used as a substitute of kelp dashi powder), tenkasu, mirin, Otafuku Okonomi Sauce or Otafuku Gluten free Okonomi Sauce (your choice of the sauce), Kewpie mayonnaise, aonori, and dried bonito."
- "To prepare the batter, mix flour, water, mirin, dashi and salt. Rest the mixture in the fridge for at least 2 hours so that all the ingredients come together. If time allows, rest it overnight. The batter will become well-blended to make a thin crepe easily. If there is no time, it&#39;s OK to use immediately, but it won&#39;t be as good."
- "Cut the cabbage in quarters and remove the core. Place the core side down, and shred the cabbage starting from the top in abjout 1/8&#34; wide strips. The width is all up to you."
- "Heat the electric griddle to 350F. Grease the griddle slightly using a paper towel. Making a thin crepe will be difficult if too much oil is added onto the griddle because a crepe will easily slide off the griddle."
- "Scoop a little less than 1/4 cup of batter, and drop it onto one side of the griddle. To make a thin crepe, spread the batter using five concentrate circles starting from the center and moving out. Do not go over the same area more than once and avoid leaving gaps in within the crepe."
- "Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon fish meal, 1/4 teaspoon kelp powder and 1/4 tablespoon chopped green onion onto each crepe."
- "Once the crepes look dry (in 10-20 seconds after spreading the batter), place one big handful of shredded cabbage and 1/2 handful of bean spouts onto each crepe."
- "Add tenkasu onto the bean sprouts. Grill the bacon aside."
- "With grilled side down, add bacon on top. Drop a tablespoon of batter onto the pile evenly so all ingredient come together. From the beginning to now, it should take 2 minutes."
- "Put the egg noodle on the grease left from the previously cooked bacon.  Add the water mixture to moisten it, and add flavor with a table spoon of Okonomi sauce. Adjust the noddle&#39;s shape so it is a circular shape slightly smaller than the crepe. Cook the pile and the flavored egg noodles for 2 minutes."
- "Once the edge of crepe looks dried and slightly lifted, flip the pile upside down. Raise the temperature of the griddle to 390F, and cook about 30 seconds. Bring the scattered cabbages under the crepe nicely with the spatula."
- "Lower the temperature of griddle to 350F.  Press down the pile with the spatula to remove the excess moisture.  Lift the pile up, rotate it and put it down for a couple of times. In this way, the cabbage is evenly steamed.  If the quality of cabbage looks dried, inject 1 tablespoon of the water mixture under the crepe using a tube. Cook for 5 minutes."
- "Place the crepe pile onto the noodle. Cook for 1 minute."
- "Crack an egg onto the griddle, and spread it in a round shape. Place the pile onto the egg spread, and cook for 30 seconds.  Flip the whole pile downside up (egg side up)."
- "Add Okonomi sauce, mayonnaise, and aonori. Bonito and pickled ginger is optional."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
