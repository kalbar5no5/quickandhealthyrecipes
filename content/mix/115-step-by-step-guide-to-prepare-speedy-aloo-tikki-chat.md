Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
