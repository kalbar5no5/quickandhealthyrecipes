Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
