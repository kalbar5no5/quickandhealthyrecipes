Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
