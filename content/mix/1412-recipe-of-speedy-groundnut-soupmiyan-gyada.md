Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
