Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
