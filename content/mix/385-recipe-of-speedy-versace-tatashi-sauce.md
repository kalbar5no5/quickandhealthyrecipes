Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
