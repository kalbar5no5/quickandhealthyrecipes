Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
