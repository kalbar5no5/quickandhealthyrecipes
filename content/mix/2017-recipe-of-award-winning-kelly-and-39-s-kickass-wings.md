Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
