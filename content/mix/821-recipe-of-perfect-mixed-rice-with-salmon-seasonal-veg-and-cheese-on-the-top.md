Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
