Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
