The key to carrot soup is, unsurprisingly, the carrots. If you can, try to get a few bundles of the smaller carrots with the stems still on. I find the bulk bags of de-stemmed carrots are less sweet. Ultimately, though, you can use any carrot—even purple or white ones—and I won&#39;t yell at you. Though this creamy carrot soup does have a wee bit more in it than just carrots, onion and garlic, they are mostly pantry essentials with the &#34;other&#34; things being optional. 

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
