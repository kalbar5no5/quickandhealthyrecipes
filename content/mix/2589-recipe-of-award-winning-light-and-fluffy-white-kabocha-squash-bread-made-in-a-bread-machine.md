Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
