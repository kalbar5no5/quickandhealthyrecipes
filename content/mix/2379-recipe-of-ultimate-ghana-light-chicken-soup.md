Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
