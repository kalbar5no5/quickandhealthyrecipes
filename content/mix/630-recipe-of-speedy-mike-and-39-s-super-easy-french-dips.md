Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
