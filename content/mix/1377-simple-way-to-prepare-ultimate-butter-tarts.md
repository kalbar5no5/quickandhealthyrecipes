Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
