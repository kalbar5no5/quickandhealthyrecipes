Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
