Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
