Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
