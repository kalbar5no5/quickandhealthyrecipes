How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
