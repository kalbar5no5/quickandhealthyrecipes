Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
