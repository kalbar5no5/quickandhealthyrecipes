Or pair it with Christmas spices and a dried fruit compote for a classy winter. Panna Cotta literally means &#34;cream cooked&#34; in Italian, and although it&#39;s often positioned as a Although Panna Cotta is generally set with gelatin, it&#39;s always struck me as odd that despite the name. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
