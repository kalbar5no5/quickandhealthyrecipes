Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
