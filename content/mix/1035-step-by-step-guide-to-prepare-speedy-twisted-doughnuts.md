Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
