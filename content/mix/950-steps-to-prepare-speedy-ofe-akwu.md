Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
