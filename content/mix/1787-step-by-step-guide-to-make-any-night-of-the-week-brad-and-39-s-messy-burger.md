Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
