- "2 Large eggs wellbeaten"
- "1/4 Cup Milk or original Almond Milk"
- "1/4 Cup Dill Pickle Juice"
- "2 Tbs. canola oil"
- "1-1/2 Tbs. Kosher Salt"
- "1 Tbs. Ground Black Pepper"
- "1  Tbs Onion Powder"
- "1  Tbs Garlic Powder"
- "1 Tbs. paprika"
- "2 tsp. Ground coriander"

- "1/4-1/2 tsp. Cayenne Pepper"
- "1-1/2 Cups Gluten Free Flour recommend Bobs Red Mill 1 for 1 or Domata Recipe Ready"
- "3-4 Quarts Vegetable or Peanut Oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl combine eggs, milk, pickle juice, canola oil, and seasonings. Beat vigorously for about 1 minute until eggs are well-beaten and mixture is foamy."
- "Add baking powder and flour and whisk until well blended. Mixture should be about the consistency of pancake batter."
- "Add all the chicken. to the wet mixture. Churn with hands for about 1 minute to work mix into the tenders. Let sit for at least 15-30 minutes. (Or refrigerate for several hours)"
- "Heat 3-4 quarts of frying oil in a heavy pot or Dutch oven to 350° F. (Tip: The heavier the pan, the better it will retain heat to maintain oil temperature)"
- "Cook the chicken in small batches to maintain oil temperature, and prevent clumping. Lower tenders into the oil gently and slowly, so not to splash hot oil or knock the batter off."
- "Fry for 7-8 minutes (depending on size of pieces) until dark golden brown. Pieces will start to float as they near doneness. As the pieces start to float, gently move and rotate them to ensure even finish of the crust."
- "Remove tenders with tongs (or spider), allow for drip for a few seconds, and place on a wire rack over sheet pan to cool. Make sure to arrange in a single-layer so pieces cool evenly and to prevent moisture from condensing. Moisture will ruin the crunch of the batter!"
- "Repeat frying until all the chicken is cooked. Make sure to allow oil to come back up to 350 degrees between batches. Frying in too cold of oil will make the chicken greasy and the crust won’t get as crunchy."
- "Lightly sprinkle chicken with sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste, after frying. Enjoy!"

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
