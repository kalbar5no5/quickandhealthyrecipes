How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
