Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
