Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
