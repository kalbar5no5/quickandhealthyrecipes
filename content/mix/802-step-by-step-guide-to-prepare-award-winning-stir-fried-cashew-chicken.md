Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
