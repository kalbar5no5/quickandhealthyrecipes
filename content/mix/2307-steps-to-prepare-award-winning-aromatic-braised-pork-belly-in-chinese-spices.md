Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
