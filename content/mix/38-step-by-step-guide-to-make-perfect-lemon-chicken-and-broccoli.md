This Lemon Chicken and Broccoli Skillet starts with seasoned chicken breasts (the boneless, skinless kind) that are pounded out to be uniform in thickness. This helps the chicken to cook more evenly and keeps the ends from drying out. The chicken is then seared in a little butter on each side for that golden brown color. Pour over the chicken breasts in a nonreactive bowl. Remove from oven and sprinkle broccoli with parmesan then sprinkle chicken with parsley if desired and garnish with lemon slices. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
