They serve picadillo there, but this has SO much more flavor - I love the sweetness of the raisins against the capers &amp; olives, along with all the spices. Saute garlic, onion and green pepper until onions are transparent.

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
