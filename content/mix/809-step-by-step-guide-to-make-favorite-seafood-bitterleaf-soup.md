Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
