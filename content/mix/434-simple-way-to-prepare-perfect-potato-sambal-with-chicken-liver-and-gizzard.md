Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
