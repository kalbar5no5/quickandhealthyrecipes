Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
