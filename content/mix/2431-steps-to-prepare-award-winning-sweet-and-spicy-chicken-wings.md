Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
