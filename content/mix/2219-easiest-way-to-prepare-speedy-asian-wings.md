Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
