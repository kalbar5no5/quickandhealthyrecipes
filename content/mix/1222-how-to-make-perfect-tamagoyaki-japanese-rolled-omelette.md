Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
