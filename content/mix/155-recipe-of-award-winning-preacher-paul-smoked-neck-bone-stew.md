Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body.
