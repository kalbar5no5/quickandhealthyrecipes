Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
