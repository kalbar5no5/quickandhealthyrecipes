Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
