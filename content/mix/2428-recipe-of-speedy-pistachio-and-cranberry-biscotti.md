Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
