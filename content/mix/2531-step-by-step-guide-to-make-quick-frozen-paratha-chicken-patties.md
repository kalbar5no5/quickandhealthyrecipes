Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
