Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
