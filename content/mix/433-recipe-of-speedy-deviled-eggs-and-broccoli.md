Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
