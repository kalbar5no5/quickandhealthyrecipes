Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
