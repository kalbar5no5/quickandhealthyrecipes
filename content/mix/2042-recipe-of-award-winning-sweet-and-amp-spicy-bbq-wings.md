Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
