Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
