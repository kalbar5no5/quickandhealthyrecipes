Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
