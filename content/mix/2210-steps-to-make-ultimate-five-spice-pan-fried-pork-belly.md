recipeingredient:
- "3 short slabs of pork belly"
- "9 Tbsp Soy sauce for marinade"
- "3 Calamansi for marinade"
- "1 tsp Salt  Pepper for marinade"
- "3 Tbsp Cooking oil"
- "1/2 lemon"
- "1/2-1 Tbsp Chinese Five Spice Powder"
- "To taste salt  pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep: a few hours or overnight before cooking.  Marinate pork belly slabs in soy sauce (enough to change meat color once absorbed) and calamansi (squeeze 1 per slab).  Set aside in chiller."
- "Take out chilled marinade of pork.   Cut a few slits on the fat side to help it remain flat on pan when frying.  Heat a non-stick pan with cooking oil. Don&#39;t put a lot, only 2-3 tbsp, as it&#39;s own oil will come out.   I used a pan big enough to fit all three."
- "Once hot enough (not too much that it will spit oil), place all 3 pork belly in pan and cover in low-medium heat.  Let it defrost in pan, let water come out. Cover 7-10 minutes.  You&#39;ll see pork thawed, cooking in its juices and fat still not rendered. This will help tenderize the pork.  Flip it on the other side, and simmer in juices for another 6-7 minutes, covered"
- "(Side 1) uncover, squeeze lemon on each and sprinkle a pinch of rock salt on each pork and fat area. Sprinkle a generous amount of five spice powder and ground black pepper.   Get a back of the spoon and use to pat and spread salt &amp; spices on belly. Cover 1 minute.  Turn bellies on other side (side 2). Increase heat to medium. Add the same to this belly sides- remaining lemon juice, pepper, salt, five spice and spread with back of spoon, then cover.   Do not flip yet. Let fat render on side 1."
- "Let fat render on side 1 in pan in medium heat. You will hear popping sounds. Peek after a few minutes, you&#39;ll smell the spices.   See if side 1 on pan has darkened in color before flipping on side 2."
- "Reduce heat, careful of oil spitting when flipping pork belly to other side.  Once flipped on side 2, increase heat to medium and cover.  Listen for popping sounds, this means the fat is rendering.  After a few minutes, peek carefully, if darkened in color, remove from heat and let oil drop on a rack before serving.  Serve with rice, veggies or potatoes. Enjoy."

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
