Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
