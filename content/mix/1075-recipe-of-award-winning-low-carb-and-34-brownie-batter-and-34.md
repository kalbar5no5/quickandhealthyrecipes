Brownies are incredible by themselves, but adding coconut meringue just raised the bar. And to think these are low carb, high protein, and gluten free. The brownie batter is very thick and it will need to be spread in the pan with a rubber spatula. And, it bakes up with that crisp cracked top that you get with regular brownies. I decided to have a treat and put a scoop of low carb vanilla ice cream on top of a warm brownie square after it came out of the oven. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
