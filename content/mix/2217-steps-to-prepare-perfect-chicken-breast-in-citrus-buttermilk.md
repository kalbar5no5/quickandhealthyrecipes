How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
