Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
