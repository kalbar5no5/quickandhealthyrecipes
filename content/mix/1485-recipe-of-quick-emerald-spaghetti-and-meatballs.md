Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
