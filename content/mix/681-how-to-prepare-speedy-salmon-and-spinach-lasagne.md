Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
