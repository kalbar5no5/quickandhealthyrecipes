How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
