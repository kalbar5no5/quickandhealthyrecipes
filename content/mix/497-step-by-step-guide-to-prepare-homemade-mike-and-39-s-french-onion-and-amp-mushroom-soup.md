Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
