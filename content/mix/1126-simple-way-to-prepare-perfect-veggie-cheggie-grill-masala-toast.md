Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
