A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood.

These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them.
