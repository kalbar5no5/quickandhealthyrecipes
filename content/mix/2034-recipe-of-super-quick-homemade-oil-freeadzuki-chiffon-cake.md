- "5 large Egg whites"
- "100 grams Cake flour"

recipeinstructions:
- "Sift the cake flour. Divide the eggs into whites and yolks. Preheat the oven to 170℃."
- "Add 2/3 of the sugar to the bowl of egg whites little by little while whipping. Make a firm meringue and chill in the fridge."
- "Add the rest of the sugar to the bowl of egg yolks and mix until it becomes thick and white. Then add water and anko."
- "Sift the flour from Step 1 again into the bowl, and mix really well. Don&#39;t mash the anko."

- "Transfer all the batter to the bowl of the meringue, and mix using a cut-and-fold motion from the bottom. Mind you don&#39;t break the foamy texture."

- "Turn the temperature down to 160℃ and bake for another 10 minutes. You can leave the temperature at 170℃ if you like. If a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean, take the cake out of the oven."
- "Invert the cake on top of a mug or cup, and wait until it has cooled down. If you try to take it out while it&#39;s still hot, it will fall apart."
- "When the cake has cooled, cut around it with a cake knife to separate it from the mold. Separate the cake from the center part with a bamboo skewer. Invert onto a plate to unmold."
- "Transfer to a serving plate and it&#39;s done."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
