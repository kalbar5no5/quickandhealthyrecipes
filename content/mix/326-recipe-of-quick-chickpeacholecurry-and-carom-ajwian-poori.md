Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
