Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
