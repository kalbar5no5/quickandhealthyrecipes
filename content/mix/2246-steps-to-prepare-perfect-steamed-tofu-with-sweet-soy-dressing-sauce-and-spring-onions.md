recipeingredient:
- " Steaming tofu"
- "1 block tofu silkensoft or medium tofu"
- "4-6 cups water steaming tofu"
- " Sweet soy dressing sauce"
- "3 teaspoons sugar caster or granulated"
- "2 tablespoons light soya sauce add more or less depending on preference"
- "4 tablespoons water"
- "1 teaspoon sesame oil pure or blended depending on preference optional"
- " Garnish"
- "1 stalk spring onion finely chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Use a large pot with a steamer basket or use a wok with a bamboo steamer. Add water and cover with lid on high heat. Bring water to a boil."
- "In the meantime, open the block of tofu, place in a bowl. Transfer the tofu on a chopping board with a paper towel on top. This drains the liquid and soaks up the excess moisture."
- "Pat the tofu with paper towel to remove excess moisture on top. Gently remove the paper towel from the board. Slice tofu across the middle horizontally."
- "Cut into 3 vertically, then horizontally down slicing tofu into cubes. Transfer to a bowl and place in steamer basket."
- "Once the water is boiling, reduce heat to medium. Place the steamer in the pot or or the bamboo steamer on top of the wok. Let the tofu steam for about 20 minutes."
- "While tofu steams, make the sweet soya dressing sauce. In a small saucepan, add the sugar, soya sauce and water. On medium heat bring mixture to a boil and keep stirring often to dissolve the sugar. Once sugar has dissolved and mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low. Add the sesame oil (if adding) now. Stir constantly and heat for another minute. Turn off the heat and set aside."
- "Once tofu has steamed, be careful when removing the steamer basket from pot as it will be hot. Place steamer basket on a large plate. Using a slotted spoon gently transfer the steamed tofu (without the excess water created from steaming) into a serving bowl. Pour all over the sweet soy dressing sauce. This will seep into the tofu making it flavoursome."
- "Lastly, garnish the tofu with spring onions. This adds a fresh taste and gives another texture to the tofu. Eat immediately while hot and serve with a bowl of rice and side accompaniments like vegetables or Thai omelette."

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
