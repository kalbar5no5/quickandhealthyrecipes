Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
