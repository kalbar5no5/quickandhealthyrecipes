Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
