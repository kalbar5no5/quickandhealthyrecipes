Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
