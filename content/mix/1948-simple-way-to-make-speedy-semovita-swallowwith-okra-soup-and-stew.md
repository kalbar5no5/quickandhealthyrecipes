Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
