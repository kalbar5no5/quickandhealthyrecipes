Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine.
