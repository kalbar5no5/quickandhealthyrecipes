How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
