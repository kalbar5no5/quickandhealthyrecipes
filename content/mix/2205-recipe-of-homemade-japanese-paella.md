##### The ingredients needed to make Japanese paella:

1. Get 2 Pacific sauries
1. Make ready 2 cup rice
1. Prepare 5-7 dried shiitake mushroom
1. Prepare 1-2 carrot
1. Take 1 head lotus root
1. Take 1 head ginger

Cut off the head and tail of the pacific sauries, take away the guts and wash it clean. Add the shrimps and short-neck clams and bring to a boil on medium heat. Paella is a traditional dish from Spain, a very tasty rice dish with seafood. But in Japan, mussel and head-on shrimp are very expensive, so I used Japanese ingredients, such as shimeji mushrooms, clams (in season now), and head-off shrimps.

Paella is a traditional dish from Spain, a very tasty rice dish with seafood. But in Japan, mussel and head-on shrimp are very expensive, so I used Japanese ingredients, such as shimeji mushrooms, clams (in season now), and head-off shrimps. Stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, and rice. Stir in saffron threads, bay leaf, parsley, chicken stock, and lemon zest. Don&#39;t Get Hung Up on Specific Ingredients. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
