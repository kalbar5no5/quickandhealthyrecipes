How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
