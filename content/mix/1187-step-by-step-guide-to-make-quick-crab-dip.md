Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
