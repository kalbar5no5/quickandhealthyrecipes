Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
