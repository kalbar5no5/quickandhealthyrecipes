Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
