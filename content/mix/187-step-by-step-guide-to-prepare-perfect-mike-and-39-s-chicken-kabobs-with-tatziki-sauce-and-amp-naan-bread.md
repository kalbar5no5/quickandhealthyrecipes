Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
