Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
