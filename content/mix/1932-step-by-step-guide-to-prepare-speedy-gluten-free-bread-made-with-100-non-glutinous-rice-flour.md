Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
