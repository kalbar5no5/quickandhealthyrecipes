Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
