Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
