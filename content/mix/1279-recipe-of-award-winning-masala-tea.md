Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
