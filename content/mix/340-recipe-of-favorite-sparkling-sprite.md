Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
