Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
