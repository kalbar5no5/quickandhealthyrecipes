Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
