Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
