Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
