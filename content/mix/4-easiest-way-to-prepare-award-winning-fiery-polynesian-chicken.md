Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
