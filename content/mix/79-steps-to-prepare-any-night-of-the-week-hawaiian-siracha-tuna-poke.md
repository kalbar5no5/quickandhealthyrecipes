Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
