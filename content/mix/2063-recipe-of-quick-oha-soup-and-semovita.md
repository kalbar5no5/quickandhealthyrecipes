Pour the cooked meat and fish with its stock into your pot of soup and add more water to the size of soup you want. Add the cocoyam paste in small lumps and red oil then cover the pot and cook on high heat until all the cocoyam lumps have dissolved. Remove the lid and stir in the pieces of oha leaves.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
