Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
