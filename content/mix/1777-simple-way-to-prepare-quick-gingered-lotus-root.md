Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
