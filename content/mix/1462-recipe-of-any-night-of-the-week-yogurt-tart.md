Scatter the fruit over the top of the tart; it will push the filling to the top of the crust. Yogurt is a food produced by the bacterial fermentation of milk. The fermentation produces lactic acid, which acts on the milk protein to give it its texture and characteristic tart flavor. Any type of milk can be used to make yogurt. Melt the gelatin heating gently for a few seconds in the microwave (do not boil it). 

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
