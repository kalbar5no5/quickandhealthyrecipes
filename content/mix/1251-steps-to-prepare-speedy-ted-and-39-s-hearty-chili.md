Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
