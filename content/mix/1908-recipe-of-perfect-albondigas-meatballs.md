Give it about 10 minutes to 15 minutes until the meatballs are firm and ready to eat. Sometimes I like to sprinkle right into the sauce just so that you can also have something to eat there but that&#39;s optional."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
