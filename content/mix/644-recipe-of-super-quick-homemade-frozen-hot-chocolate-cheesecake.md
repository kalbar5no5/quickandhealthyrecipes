Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
