Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
