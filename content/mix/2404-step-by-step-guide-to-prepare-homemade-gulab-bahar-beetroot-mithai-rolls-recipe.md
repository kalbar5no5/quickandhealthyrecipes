Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
