Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
