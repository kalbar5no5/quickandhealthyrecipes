Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
