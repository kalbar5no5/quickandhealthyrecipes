Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
