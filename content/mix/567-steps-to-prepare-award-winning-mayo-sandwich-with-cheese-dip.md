Instead of using philly cream cheese use an organic and/or grass-fed version. There are plenty of raw milk cheeses, grass-fed cheese, even yogurt cultured cheeses. I do agree about the mayo as most brands are made with soy and/or canola oil - no bueno. Since I am not up for the task of making my own I use the soy-free veganaise.

I do agree about the mayo as most brands are made with soy and/or canola oil - no bueno. Since I am not up for the task of making my own I use the soy-free veganaise. This dip tastes just like a Reuben sandwich but unless you keep it hot the cheese congeals into a gluey impossible-to-scoop-up mess. Let&#39;s start off with a classic combo: honey mustard mayo! This spread is great for adding a little pizazz to a humdrum sandwich. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
