Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
