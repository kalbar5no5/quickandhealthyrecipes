- "1 Head Cabbage"
- "6-8 Slices if thick cut bacon"
- "Half Stick Butter"
- " Few Cloves Garlic"
- " Onion Powder"
- " Garlic Salt"
- " Black Pepper"
- " Chicken Stock"
recipeinstructions:
- "Core your cabbage and slice it up. Put in a strainer or colander or whatever and wash it. Let it drain for a bit."
- "Start cooking down the bacon with the garlic. You don’t have to incinerate it. You’re just trying to get the fat out of it to pan fry the cabbage."
- "When you’ve got the fat rendered out of the bacon, throw the cabbage in and season it well. (I go a little heavier than usual on the salt because it’s going to steam afterwards). Throw the butter on top of the cabbage and cover with lid. When the butter has melted, stir it up and continue to fry until it’s got some colour. Add about a half cup of stock, cover and steam until evaporated and fork tender. If it’s not fork tender, (it can have a little crunch) add more stock and keep steaming."
- "When liquid is evaporated and cabbage is tender, heat it with some high heat, mixing with tongs frequently. It’ll give it the last bit of colour to bring it home."

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
