Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
