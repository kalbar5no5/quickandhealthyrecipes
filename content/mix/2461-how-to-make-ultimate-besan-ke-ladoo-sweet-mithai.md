How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
