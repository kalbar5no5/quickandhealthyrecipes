Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
