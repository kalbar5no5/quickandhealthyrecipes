Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
