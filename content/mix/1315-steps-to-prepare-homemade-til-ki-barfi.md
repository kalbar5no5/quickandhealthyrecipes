Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
