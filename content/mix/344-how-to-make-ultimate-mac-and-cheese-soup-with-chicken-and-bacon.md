Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
