Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
