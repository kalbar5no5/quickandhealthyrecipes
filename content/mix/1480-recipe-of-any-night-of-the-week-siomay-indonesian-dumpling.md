Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
