Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better.
