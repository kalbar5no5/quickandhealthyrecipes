Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!
