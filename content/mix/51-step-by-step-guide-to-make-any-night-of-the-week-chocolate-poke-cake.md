Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
