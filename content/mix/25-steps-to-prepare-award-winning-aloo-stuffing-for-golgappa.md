Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
