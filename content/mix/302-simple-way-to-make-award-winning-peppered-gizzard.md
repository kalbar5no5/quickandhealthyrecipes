Wash gizzards (remove the green parts and fats) into a pot and pre boil(I always pre boil offals to remove the excess blood and impurities) After preboiling and washing, season with salt, dry pepper, Knorr, thyme, curry, and onion wedges There is really nothing special about cooking gizzard, you just want it soft and tasty so you can use the same technique employed when cooking chicken or beef. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
