Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
