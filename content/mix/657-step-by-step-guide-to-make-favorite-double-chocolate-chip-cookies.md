Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
