Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
