Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
