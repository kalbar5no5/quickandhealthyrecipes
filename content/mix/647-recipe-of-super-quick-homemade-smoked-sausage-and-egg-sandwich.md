Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
