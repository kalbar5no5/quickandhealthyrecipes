- " kosher salt"
- "3 tsp garlic powder divided"
- "2 tsp cayenne powder divided"
- "3 cups buttermilk divided"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 cups flour Bread or AP"
- "3/4 cup corn starch"
- "2 tsp baking powder"
- "1 tsp dried mustard"
- "1 tsp dried ginger"
- "2 cups AP flour"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1/4 cup powdered sugar"

- "4 large egg whites beaten"
- "2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 tsp maple syrup extract"
- "4 cups vegetable oil for frying I used peanut oil"
- " Bamboo skewers"
- " Cooking spray"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine 1 cup buttermilk (reserve 3 tbsp) with paprika, black pepper, and 1/2 the garlic powder and cayenne in a Ziploc bag. Add 1/2 tsp kosher salt as well. Mix well then add chicken. Marinate for 2-12 hours in the refrigerator."
- "Whisk flour, corn starch, a pinch of kosher salt, baking powder and dried ginger and mustard together in a large, shallow bowl. Sprinkle about 4 tbsp of your marinade into the flour mix."
- "Using your fingers work the marinade around in the flour until you get some dry chunks in there. These chunks will lend to the crispiness of your fried chicken"
- "Setup your breading station. In addition to your craggy flour mix you&#39;ll combine your eggs and the remaining buttermilk in another bowl. Also have a third empty plate to place your breaded chicken fingers."
- "Place each piece of chicken in the flour first, then the egg wash, then the flour again. Make sure to get those crags stuck to your chicken fingers.

For a good explanation on this method check out http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/02/the-food-lab-all-american-eggplant-parmesan.html"
- "Pile your chicken on the plate. I didn&#39;t separate my chicken fingers and it led to a lot of stickage as the breading got moist. So I recommend separating the chicken fingers and stacking with sheets of parchment paper. Go ahead an add your oil to a large cast iron dutch oven or skillet at this point and heat to about 340F."
- "Whisk together 2 cups of AP flour, baking soda, baking powder and powdered sugar. Then add the wet ingredients: melted butter, 2 cups buttermilk, egg whites, and maple and vanilla extracts. Whisk until smooth."
- "Fry up your chicken fingers in the preheated oil. You&#39;re looking for a golden brown fried-chickeny looking color about 4 minutes on one side. Using tongs, carefully agitate the chicken so you don&#39;t get any hotspots sticking to the pan. At 4 minutes flip you&#39;re chicken fingers and cook for another 3-4 minutes on the other side. Repeat for all the chicken."
- "Stick the bamboo skewers into each individual chicken finger. You&#39;ve not got chicken on a stick."
- "Pre-heat a waffle iron and spray with cooking spray. Pour a little waffle mix in the bottom of the iron, about halfway to what you would use to make a regular waffles. Put two chicken skewers down on the iron (one on each half. Pour about half the amount of the original pour over the chicken."
- "Close waffle iron and cook according to your waffle-ironing instructions. Try not to pour too much as you will have waffle mix all over your counter (I know this from experience). These waffles will puff up about twice the size of the batter when cooked. Split the waffles, sprinkle with maple syrup or dip in ketchup. It&#39;s chicken and a waffle, you can do that. Enjoy!"

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
