How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
