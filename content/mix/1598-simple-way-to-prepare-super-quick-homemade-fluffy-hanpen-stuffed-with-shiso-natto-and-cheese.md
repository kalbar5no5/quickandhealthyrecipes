Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
