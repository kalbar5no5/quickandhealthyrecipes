Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
