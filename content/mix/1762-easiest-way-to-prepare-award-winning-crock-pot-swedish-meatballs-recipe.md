Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
