Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
