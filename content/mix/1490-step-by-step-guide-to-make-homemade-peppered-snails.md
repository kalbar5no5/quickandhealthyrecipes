Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
