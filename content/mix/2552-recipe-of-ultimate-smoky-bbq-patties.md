Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
