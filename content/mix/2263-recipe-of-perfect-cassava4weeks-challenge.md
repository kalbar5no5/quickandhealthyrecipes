Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
