Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
