Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
