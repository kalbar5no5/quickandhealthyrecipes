Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
