Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
