How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
