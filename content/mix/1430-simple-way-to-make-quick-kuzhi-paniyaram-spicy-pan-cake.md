Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
