Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
