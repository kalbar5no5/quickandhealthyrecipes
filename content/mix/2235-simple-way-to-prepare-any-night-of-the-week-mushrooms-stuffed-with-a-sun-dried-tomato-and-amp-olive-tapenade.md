Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
