How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
