Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
