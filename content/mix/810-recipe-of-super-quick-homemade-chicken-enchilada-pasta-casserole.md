Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
