Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
