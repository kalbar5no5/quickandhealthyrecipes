Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
