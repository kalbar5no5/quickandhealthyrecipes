Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
