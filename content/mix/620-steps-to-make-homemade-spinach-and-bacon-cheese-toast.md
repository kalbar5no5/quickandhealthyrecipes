Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
