Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
