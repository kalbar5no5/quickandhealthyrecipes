Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
