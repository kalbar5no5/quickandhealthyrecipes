Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
