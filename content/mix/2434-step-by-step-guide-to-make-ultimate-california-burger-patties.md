Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
