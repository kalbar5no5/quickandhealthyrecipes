Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
