Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
