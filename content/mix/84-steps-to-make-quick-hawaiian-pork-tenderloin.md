Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
