Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
