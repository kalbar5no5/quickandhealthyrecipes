Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
