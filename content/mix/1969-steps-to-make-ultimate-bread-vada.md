Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
