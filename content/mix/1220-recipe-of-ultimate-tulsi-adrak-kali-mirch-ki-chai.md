Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
