Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
