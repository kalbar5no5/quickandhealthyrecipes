Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
