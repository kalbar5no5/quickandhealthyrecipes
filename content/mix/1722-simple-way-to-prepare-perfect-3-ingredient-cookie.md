Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
