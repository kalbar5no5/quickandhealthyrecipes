Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
