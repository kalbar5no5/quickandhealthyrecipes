Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
