Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
