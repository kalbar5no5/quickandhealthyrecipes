Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
