Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
