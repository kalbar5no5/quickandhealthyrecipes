Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
