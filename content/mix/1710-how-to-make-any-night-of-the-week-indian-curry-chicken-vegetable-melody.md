In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
