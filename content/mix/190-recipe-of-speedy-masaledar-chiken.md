Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
