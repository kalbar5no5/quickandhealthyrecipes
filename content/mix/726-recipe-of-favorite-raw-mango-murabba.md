Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
