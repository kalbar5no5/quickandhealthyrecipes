How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
