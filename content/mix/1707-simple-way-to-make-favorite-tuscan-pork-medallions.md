Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
