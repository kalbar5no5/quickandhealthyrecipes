Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
