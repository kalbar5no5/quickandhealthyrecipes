Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
