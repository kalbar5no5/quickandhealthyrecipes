Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
