Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
