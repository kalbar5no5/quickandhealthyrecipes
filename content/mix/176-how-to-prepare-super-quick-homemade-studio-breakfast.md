Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
