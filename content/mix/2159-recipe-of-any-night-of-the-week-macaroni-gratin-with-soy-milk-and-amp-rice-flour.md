How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
