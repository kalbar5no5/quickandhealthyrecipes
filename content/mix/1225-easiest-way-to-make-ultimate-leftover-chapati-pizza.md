Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
