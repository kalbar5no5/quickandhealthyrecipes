Soft cheeses can be used, but handle carefully as it will melt quickly. Blue cheeses also work well but do make sure it is mature and semi-hard. Butter a slice of white bread on both sides. Try sourdough for a tangy flavor, or an airy bread like ciabatta if you like the cheese oozing through the holes and burning on the pan. Buttering both sides will create a golden crust and a moist interior. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
