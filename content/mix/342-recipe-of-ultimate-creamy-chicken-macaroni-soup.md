Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
