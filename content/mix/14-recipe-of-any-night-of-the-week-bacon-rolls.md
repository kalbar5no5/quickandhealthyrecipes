Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
