Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
