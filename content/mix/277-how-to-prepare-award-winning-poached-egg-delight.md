Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
