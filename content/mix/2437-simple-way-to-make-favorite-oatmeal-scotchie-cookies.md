Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
