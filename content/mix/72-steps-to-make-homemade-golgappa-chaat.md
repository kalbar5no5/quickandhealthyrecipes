How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
