Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
