Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
