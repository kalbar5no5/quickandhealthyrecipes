Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
