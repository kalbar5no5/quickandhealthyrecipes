Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
