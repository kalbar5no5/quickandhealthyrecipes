Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
