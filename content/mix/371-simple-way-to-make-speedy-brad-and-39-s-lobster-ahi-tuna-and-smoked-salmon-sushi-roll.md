Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
