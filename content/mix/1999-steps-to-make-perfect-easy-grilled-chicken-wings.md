Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
