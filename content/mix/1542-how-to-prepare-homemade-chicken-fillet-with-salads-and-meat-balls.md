Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
