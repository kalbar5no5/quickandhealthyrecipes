Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
