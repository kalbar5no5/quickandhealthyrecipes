Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
