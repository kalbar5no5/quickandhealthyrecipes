Yakisoba (焼きそば) is the Japanese version of stir-fried noodles. The noodles are cooked with sliced pork and plenty of vegetables (cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, onion and shallots/scallions), then coated with a special sauce. Chicken or beef would also work well instead of pork. Cook the soba noodles according to the package directions. Once they&#39;re done cooking, drain them in a colander and rinse them well under cool water. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
