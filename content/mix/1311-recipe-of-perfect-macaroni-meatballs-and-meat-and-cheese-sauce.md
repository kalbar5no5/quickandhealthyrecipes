Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
