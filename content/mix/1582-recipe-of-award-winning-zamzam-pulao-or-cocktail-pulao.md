Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
