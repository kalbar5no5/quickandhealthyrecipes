Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
