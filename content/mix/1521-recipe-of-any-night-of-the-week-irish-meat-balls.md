How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
