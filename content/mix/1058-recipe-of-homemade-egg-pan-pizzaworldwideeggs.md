How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
