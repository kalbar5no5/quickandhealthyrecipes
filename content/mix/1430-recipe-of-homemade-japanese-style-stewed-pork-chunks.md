Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
