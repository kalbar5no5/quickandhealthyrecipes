Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
