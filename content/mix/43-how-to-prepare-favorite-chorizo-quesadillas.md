Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
