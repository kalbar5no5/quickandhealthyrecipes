Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
