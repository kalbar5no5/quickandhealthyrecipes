Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
