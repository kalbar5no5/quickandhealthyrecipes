recipeinstructions:
- "Cook your brown rice on a pot or through rice cooker. Follow instruction according to its package."
- "Boil egg for 7 mins on a small pot, and let it rest for 1-2 min before fishing it out to set aside. While egg is boiling, chop what needed to be chopped, and wash/clean your seafood."
- "Let&#39;s begin making the stock. Heat large soup pot over high heat. When it smokes a bit, turn down heat to medium, wait for 10 sec., then splash a dash of olive oil. Sautee onion until transluscent, add in garlic and ginger and keep stir frying for about 30 seconds."
- "Add your seafood of choice on soup pot and stir-fry until half-cooked, then add fish sauce (or the alternative), water, and lemon/lime juice. Cover and let it simmer until seafood is cooked. Note: consider that rice will be added later, thus adjust salt level accordingly (stock can be a tad bit salty but it will mellow down with rice later). Turn off the heat. Fish-out the cooked seafood set them aside as it would be used as garnish. Set aside the pot of stock."
- "Using a regular frying pan, heat it up over high heat. When it smokes a bit, turn down heat to medium, wait for 10 sec., then splash a dash of olive oil. Fry bell peppers for few seconds, then fish &#39;em out to set aside as garnish for later. Do the same for the turkey sausage (or chorizo)."
- "On the same pan, Sautee onion until transluscent. Add in garlic, sautee until almost golden brown, then stir-in tomatoes, turmeric, and paprika. Keep on stirring while mashing them up well."
- "Add 1 cup of seafood stock on pot. Stir. Then add 2 cups of cooked brown rice and stir well. [yes, that&#39;s the trick: double cooking and rehydrating the brown rice will make &#39;em extra sticky/muschy]. Add more stock if necessary. Turn heat to medium low."
- "The hallmark of every delicious arroz a la valenciana or paella is scorching the bottom of the rice just a bit to make it crispy/crunchy, and not burnt. Your nose can tell if rice is toasted, or burnt. But you can also use a spatula to occassionally check on one side."
- "While the rice is still being toasted over medium low heat, take your hard boiled egg, peel off the egg shell, and slice it up. This is for garnishing as well."
- "Decorate/garnish the arroz a la valenciana while it is still reducing the stock. Arrange the seafood, bell pepper, sliced eggs, and sausage rhythmically around the pan. Occassionally smell-and-view check the bottom to know if the rice is perfectly toasted -- if it is, then it is done and ready to serve! Don&#39;t forget to turn off your burner."
- "Serve it on a frying pan! Enjoy!"

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
