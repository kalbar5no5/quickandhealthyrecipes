Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
