Cornish Pasties While pastry has served as a container for food for centuries, a Cornish pasty is unique to Cornwall. It&#39;s a tangible reminder of its mining past, although people now eat them whenever a quick and portable meal is needed. According to history.com Cornish pasties originated in ancient England in the Cornwall region. These hand pies were a popular food for families, fishermen and even more so for the miners in that region. The reason for this is, because the pasty was a convenient and easy way to eat when down in the mine. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
