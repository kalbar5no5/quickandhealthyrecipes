Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
