Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood.

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood.

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest.
