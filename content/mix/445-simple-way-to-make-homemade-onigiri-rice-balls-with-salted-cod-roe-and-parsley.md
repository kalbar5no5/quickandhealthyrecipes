Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
