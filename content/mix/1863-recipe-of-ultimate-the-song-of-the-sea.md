Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
