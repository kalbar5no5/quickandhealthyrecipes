Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
