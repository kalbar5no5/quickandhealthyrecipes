Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
