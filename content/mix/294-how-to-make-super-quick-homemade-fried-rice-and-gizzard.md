Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
