Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
