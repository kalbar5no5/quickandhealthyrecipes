Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
