This magical macaroni dish will make a disappearing act on the dinner table. I&#39;ve not only served it up as a main dish during the week, but I&#39;ve served it as a side dish on the Thanksgiving table. It&#39;s got ham and cheese, but I think the secret ingredients are the half-and-half and eggs. Macaroni and cheese is one of those dishes that seems super easy to make, but many people can&#39;t get it right. I&#39;ve had so many terrible versions made by others…super soggy overcooked pasta, clumpy bland cheese, dry and flavorless…the list goes on. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
