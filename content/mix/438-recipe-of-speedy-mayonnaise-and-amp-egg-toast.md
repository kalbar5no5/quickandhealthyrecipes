Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
