Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
