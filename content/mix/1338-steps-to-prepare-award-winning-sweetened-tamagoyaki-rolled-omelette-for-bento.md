Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
