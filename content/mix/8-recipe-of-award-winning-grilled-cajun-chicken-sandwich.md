Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
