Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
