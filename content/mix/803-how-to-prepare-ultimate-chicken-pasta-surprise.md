Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
