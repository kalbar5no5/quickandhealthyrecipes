recipeingredient:
- "2 racks pork ribs"
- "1 head garlic dont take off skin leave whole"
- "1 beer of choice bitter not too sweet"
- "1 tablespoon paprika"
- "1/2 tablespoon honey"
- "1/2 tablespoon olive oil"
- "2 teaspoons onion powder"
- "2 teaspoons fresh cracked pepper"
- "2 teaspoons cumin"
- "2 teaspoons cloves"
- " Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pat dry your ribs and place them in a large oven pan. Cut the garlic head in half so that you kinda have 2 discs of garlic, leaving the garlic cloves attached."
- "Create dry rub by mixing the paprika, onion powder, cumin, cloves, salt, and fresh cracked pepper. Save one tablespoon of this mix for later."
- "Mix the olive oil and honey so that the honey is runny. Rub this mixture over the ribs. Using this base, evenly coat the entire rack with the spice mix."
- "Place the spiced pork rack in the slow cooker, making sure to put the wider/fatter end down and the meatier end toward the walls of the cooker. This will help the meat to cook evenly."
- "Empty the bottle of beer into the slow cooker. I used whatever I had in my fridge left over from a party, I think like an IPA? Just make sure it&#39;s not a sweet beer, but a more tart/bitter one. Toss the garlic in the beer broth."
- "Cook on high for 5-6 hours, or low for 6-7 hours. Check on your ribs towards the last hour of the cook time, depending on meat and slow cooker this might take longer/shorter. Take out of slow cooker once meat starts falling off of the bone."
- "Coat with barbeque sauce as wanted. bbq sauce has a lot of sugar so I grilled my ribs in herb butter, instead. Make sure to grill the garlic as well, once it&#39;s cooked and crispy on the outside, it becomes soft and buttery on the inside."
- "I served with roasted Japanese sweet potatoes."
- "Optional trick with the garlic: toast some bread, drizzle with light olive oil, and spread the grilled garlic over it. Delicious garlic bread!"

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
