Roasted garlic has the best flavor. When you blend it with goat cheese and tomatoes, you will getthese wonderful Goat Cheese Tomato Tarts. This recipe also calls for a blend of herbs that make the tarts especially savory. I like to grow my own herbs, such as thyme and basil.

This recipe also calls for a blend of herbs that make the tarts especially savory. I like to grow my own herbs, such as thyme and basil. Roma tomatoes work well for this upscale pizza-ish tart, being meaty and not as juicy as beefsteak tomatoes, but you could use either. Roast them, then drop on spoonfuls of soft goat cheese or Boursin. I&#39;m sure there a thousand other things you could do with it, as with roasted tomatoes: add garlic, or herbs, or caramelized onions. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
