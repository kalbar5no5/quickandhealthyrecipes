Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
