Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
