Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
