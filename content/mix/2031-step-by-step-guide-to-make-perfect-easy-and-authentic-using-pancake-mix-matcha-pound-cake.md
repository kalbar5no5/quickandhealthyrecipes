Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
