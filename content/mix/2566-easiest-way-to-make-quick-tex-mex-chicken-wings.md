Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
