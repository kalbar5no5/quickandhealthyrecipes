How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
