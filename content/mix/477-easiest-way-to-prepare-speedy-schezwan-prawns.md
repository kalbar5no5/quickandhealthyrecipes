How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
