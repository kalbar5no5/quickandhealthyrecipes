Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
