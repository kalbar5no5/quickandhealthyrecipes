Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
