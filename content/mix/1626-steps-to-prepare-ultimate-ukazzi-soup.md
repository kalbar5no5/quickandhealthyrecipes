Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
