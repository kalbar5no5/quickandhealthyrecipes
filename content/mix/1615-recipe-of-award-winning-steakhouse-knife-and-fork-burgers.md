Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!
