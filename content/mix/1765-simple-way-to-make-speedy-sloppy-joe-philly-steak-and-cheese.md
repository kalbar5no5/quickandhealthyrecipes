How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
