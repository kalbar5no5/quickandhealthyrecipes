Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
