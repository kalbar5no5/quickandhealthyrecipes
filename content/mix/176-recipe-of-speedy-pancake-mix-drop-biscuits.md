Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
