Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
