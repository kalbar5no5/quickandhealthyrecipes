Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
