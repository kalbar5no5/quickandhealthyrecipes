Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
