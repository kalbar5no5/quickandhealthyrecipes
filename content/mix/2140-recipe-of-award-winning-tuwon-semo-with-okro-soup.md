Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
