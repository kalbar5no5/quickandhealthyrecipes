Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine.
