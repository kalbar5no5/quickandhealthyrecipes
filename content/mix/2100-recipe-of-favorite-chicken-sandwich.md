Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
