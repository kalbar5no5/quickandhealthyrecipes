Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
