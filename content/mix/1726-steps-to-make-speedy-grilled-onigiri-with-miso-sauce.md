Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
