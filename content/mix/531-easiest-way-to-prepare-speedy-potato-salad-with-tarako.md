Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
