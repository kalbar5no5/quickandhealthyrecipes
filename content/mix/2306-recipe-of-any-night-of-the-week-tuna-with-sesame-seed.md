Hey everyone, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, tuna with sesame seed. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Easy, great tasting tuna coated with sesame seeds, and quickly seared. This tuna is served rare, so be sure to use a good quality fresh tuna. Sesame Seeds - don&#39;t bother - I&#39;ve tried it both ways, they don&#39;t add much, and they pop all over the place when you sear the steaks and make a mess. Dredge and press tuna in sesame seeds, coating evenly.


To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook tuna with sesame seed using 5 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
