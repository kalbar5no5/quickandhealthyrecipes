Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
