Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
