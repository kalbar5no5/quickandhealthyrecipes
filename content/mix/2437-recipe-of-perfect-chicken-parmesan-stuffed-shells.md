Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
