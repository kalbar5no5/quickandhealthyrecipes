Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
