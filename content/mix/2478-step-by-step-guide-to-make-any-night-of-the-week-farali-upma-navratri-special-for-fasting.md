The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!
