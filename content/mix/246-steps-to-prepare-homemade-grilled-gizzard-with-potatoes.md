Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
