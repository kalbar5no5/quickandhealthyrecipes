Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
