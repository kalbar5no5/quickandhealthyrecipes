Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
