Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
