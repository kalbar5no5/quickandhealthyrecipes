- "100 grams Bread strong flour"
- "15 grams Sugar"
- "15 grams Miso"
- "10 grams Grated ginger"
- "2 grams Dry yeast"
- "75 grams Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the miso, water, and ginger in a heatproof bowl, and microwave for 1 minute to kill off the micro-organisms in the miso. If you don&#39;t do this, the dough will not rise well."
- "When the step 1 mixture has cooled down, put it in the bread machine along with the rest of the ingredients. Leave it up to the bread machine until the end of the 1st rising."
- "Take the dough out onto a floured work surface, and cut into 4 portions. It&#39;s best to weigh the dough properly here for evenly sized rolls."
- "Cover the dough with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel and rest for 15 minutes. Round off each ball of dough again, place on a baking sheet, cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel and leave for the 2nd rising for about 40 minutes."
- "When the dough has increased to about 1.5 times its original volume, bake in a preheated 180°C oven for 20 minutes. You can slash the tops or dust with some cake flour or whatever you prefer."
- "The rolls puffed up very nicely."
- "The slight ginger scent is very interesting. The bread is moist and chewy."

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body.
