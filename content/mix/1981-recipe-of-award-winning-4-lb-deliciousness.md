Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
