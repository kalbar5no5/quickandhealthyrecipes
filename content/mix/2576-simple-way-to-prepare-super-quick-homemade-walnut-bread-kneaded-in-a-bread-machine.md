Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
