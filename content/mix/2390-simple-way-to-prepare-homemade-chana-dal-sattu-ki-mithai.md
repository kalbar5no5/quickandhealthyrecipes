Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
