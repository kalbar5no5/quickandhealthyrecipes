Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
