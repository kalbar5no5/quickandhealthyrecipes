Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
