Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
