Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!
