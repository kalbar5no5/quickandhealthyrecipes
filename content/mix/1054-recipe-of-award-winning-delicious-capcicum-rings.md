Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
