It is great for vegan cheesecakes, pumpkin or apple pie and other desserts. This started with the idea to whip up granola and use it like cracker crumbs in a crust. I had too many ideas about how to top it, and it is a cereal contest, so I decided to make a cheesecake incorporating grits. Top cheesecake-crust-without-graham-crackers recipes just for you. These savory granola bars taste like Cheez-Its but include the irresistable textures of oats, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and chia seeds. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
