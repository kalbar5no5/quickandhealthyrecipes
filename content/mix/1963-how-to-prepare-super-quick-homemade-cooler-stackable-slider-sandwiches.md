Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
