Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
