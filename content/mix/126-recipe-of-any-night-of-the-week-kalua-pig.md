Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
