Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
