- "After the boiling, season with your cajun spice. Cajun spice is a spice blend with paprika, onion powder, rosemary, pepper, etc and all those flavors compliment any chicken dish so well.

- "In a blender, blitz the pineapple together with the ACV until thick and pureed then set aside. Make sure your pineapple is super sweet, if it is sour everything will be thrown off completely"
- "To you sufuria, add your onion and garlic to the sufuria, sautee until softened. Add the ketchup, brown sugar, pepper, chili and mix it all in."
- "Thereafter, add the ginger (tangawizi) and pureed pineapple. Taste with each addition and adjust the ingredients to match you personal preferences."
- "Let this simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes"
- "Once the bbq sauce is done, then add the fried, perfectly seasoned, perfectly marinated chicken."
- "Toss them in and once coated you are done! Garnish with finely chopped dania and dig right in. Served mine with friesðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹"

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
