Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
