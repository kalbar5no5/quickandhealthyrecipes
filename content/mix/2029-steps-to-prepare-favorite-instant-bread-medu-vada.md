How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
