Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
