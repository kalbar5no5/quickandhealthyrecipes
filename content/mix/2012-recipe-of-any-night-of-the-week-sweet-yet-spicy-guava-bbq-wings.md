Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
