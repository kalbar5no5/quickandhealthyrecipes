How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
