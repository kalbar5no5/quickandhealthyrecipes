Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
