Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
