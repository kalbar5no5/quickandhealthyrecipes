How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
