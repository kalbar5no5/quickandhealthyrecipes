Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
