How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
