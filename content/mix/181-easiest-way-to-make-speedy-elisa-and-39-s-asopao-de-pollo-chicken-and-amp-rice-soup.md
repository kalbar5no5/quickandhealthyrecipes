A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!
