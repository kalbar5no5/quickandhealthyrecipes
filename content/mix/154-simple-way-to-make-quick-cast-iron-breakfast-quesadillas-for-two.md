Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
