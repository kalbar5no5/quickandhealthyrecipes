Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body.
