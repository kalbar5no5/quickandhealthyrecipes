Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
