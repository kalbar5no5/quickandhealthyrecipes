Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
