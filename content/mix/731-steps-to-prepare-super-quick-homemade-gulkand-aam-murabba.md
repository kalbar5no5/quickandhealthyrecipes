Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
