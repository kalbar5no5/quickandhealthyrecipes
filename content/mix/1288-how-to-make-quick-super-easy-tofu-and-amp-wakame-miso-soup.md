Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
