Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
