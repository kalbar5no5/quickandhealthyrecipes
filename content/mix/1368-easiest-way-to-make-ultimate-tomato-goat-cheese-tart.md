Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
