How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
