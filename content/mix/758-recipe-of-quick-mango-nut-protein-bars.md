How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
