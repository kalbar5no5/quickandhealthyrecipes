Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
