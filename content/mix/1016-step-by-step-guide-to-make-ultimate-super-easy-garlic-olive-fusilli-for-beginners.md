Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
