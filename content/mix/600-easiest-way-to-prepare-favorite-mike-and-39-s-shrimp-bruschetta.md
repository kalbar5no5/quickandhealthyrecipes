recipeinstructions:
- "If using [dried] sun dried tomatoes - place them in 1/2 cup red wine and enough water to cover them. Boil until soft. About 3 minutes. Drain and chop. If not, fine chop and place in frying pan."
- "If serving a Chilled or Warmed Bruchetta - chop your tomatoes and fully drain your canned artichokes. Gently squeeze artichokes in cheese cloth or a clean towel to complete straining if needed. You can use artichokes in oil - just shake them off and drain as much as you can."
- "For a Warmed Bruschetta:                                Add 2 tbs olive oil to your pan, heat it up and add your onions, garlic, sun dried tomatoes and shrimp.                                                                            Fry until onions and garlic are just translucent and shrimp are pink. About three minutes. You&#39;ll want a slight crisp to your veggies so don&#39;t over cook them. Or, burn your garlic. ° Shrimp not pictured. It was a little late arriving!"
- "Add your tomato mixture and cook until heated. About 2 minutes.               One tip if you have the time: Sit your fresh basil and fresh parsley to the side - add them to your heated tomato mixture and toss 35 seconds before serving."
- "For a Chilled Bruschetta:                                Use pre-steamed shrimp instead of the raw called for in the warmed bruchetta. Drain your artichokes well.                                                                      Mix everything in a large bowl. Allow it all to marinate for at least an hour in the fridge. The sea salt will help pull some additional fluids from both your tomatoes and artichokes."
- "When ready to serve - mix again - pull contents from marinade bowl and place on toasted bread. Sprinkle tops with fresh shaved Parmesan Cheese and garnish with fresh basil, parsley, black pepper and sea salt."
- "Pile tomato mixture on top of toasted seasoned bread. Sprinkle with fresh shaved Parmesan Cheese and garnish with fresh basil, parsley, black pepper and sea salt."
- "Slice bread 1&#34; thick and grill [or toast] until scored and crispy. Add butter, garlic butter, olive oil or scrape grilled bread tops with raw garlic cloves while the bread is still warm."

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
