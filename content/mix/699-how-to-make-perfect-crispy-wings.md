Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
