Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
