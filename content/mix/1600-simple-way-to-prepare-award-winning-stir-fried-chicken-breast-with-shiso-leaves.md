Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
