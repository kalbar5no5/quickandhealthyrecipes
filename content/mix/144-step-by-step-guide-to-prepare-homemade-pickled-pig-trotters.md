Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
