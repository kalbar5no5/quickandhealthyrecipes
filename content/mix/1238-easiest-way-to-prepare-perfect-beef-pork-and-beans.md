Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
