Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
