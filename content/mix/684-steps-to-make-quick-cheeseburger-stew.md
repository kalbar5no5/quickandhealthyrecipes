Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
