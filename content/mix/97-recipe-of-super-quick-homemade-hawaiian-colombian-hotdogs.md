Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
