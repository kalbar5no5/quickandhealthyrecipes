How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
