Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
