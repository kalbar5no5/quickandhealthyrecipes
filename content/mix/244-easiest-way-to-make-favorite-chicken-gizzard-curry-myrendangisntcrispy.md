A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood.

Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them.
