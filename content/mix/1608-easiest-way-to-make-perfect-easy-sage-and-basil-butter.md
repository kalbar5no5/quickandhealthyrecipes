Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
