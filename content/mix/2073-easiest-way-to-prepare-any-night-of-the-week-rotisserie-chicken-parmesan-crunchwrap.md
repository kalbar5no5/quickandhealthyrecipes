Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
