Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
