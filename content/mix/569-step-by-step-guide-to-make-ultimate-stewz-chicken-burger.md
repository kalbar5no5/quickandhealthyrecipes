Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
