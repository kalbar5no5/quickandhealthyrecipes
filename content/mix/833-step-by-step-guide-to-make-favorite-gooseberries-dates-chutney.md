Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy-based pan over a medium heat. Other spices may be used if desired, a little mace and cinnamon blending well with the tart berries in the vinegar and sugar sirup. Combine all the ingredients in a large, heavy saucepan. I make this chutney by first cooking the gooseberries until they soften. Then I add onions and vinegar and cook some more before adding the rest of the ingredients and boiling until the mixture thickens. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
