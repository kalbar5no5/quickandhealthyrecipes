Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
