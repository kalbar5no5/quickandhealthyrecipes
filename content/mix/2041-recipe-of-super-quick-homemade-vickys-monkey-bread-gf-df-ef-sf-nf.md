- "220 grams potato starch 1  14 cups"
- "200 grams rice flour 1  14 cups"
- "65 grams granulated sugar"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1 1/4 tsp xanthan gum"
- "113 grams applesauce"
- "2 tbsp coconut oil melted"
- "180 ml coconut milk warmed to 100F"
- "2 1/2 tsp fast acting yeast"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to gas 5 / 190C/ 375°F"
- "Grease an 8&#34;or 9&#34; round tin with spray oil"
- "Mix the flour, starch, salt, sugar and xanthan gum in a bowl"
- "Add the applesauce and coconut oil, warmed milk and yeast. Mix together to form a soft dough"
- "It should be more batter-like, a very soft dough, not sticky but not dense at all. If you made a ball of it and dropped it on counter top it would flatten a little. Don&#39;t be tempted to add more flour thinking that the dough is too soft"

- "Invert onto a serving plate and enjoy. Any leftovers can be frozen for up to 3 months. Just defrost then warm through in the oven at the same temp for 4 minutes to refresh them"
- "If you want the caramel sauce topping to make the doughnuts into monkey bread, melt the leftover cinnamon sugar with just over 3/4 it&#39;s weight of butter in a pan until the sugar has dissolved"
- "Pour over the coated donuts and bake for 25 - 30 minutes"
- "Let cool in the tin for 10 minutes to let the caramel sauce thicken then invert onto a serving plate"
- "It&#39;s probably better to make the balls half the size if doing this, around an inch wide, just because of the sweetness"

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
