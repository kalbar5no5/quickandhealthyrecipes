Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
