Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
