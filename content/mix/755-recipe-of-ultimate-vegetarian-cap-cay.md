If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed.
