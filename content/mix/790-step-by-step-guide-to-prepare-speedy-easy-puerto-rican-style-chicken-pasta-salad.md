Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
