Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
