Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
