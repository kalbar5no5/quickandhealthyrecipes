Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
