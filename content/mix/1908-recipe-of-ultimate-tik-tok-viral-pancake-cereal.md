Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
