recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the ginger nicely. Peel out the upper layer. Chop it and add it to an electric chopper so that we get finely chopped ginger pieces. Heat 1 tbsp coconut oil in a pan. Add the finely chopped ginger pieces to it and fry till the ginger turns light brown in colour and the moisture has reduced. Remove the fried ginger and set aside."
- "In the same pan, add 2 tbsp coconut oil and 1 tbsp saffola oil. When the oil is hot, add mustard seeds and allow it to splutter. Add green chillies and curry leaves and saute for few seconds. Add the finely chopped onions and saute till the onions are light brown."
- "Add the turmeric powder and chilli powder and saute for few seconds. Now off the flame. Add fenugreek powder and mix well. This helps to avoid the burning of the fenugreek powder."
- "Heat 1 cup of water. Add 3-4 medium pieces of jaggery to it and allow it to dissolve. Strain and keep it ready. Turn the flame on and add a little solution of jaggery to make a thick paste. Cook this mixture till the oil separates. This enhances the flavor of the dish."
- "Now add the tamarind paste, salt, fried ginger and the remaining jaggery solution. Mix well and let it come to a boil. Let it cook till the mixture thickens a bit. Adjust salt and jaggery, if need be."

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
