Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!
