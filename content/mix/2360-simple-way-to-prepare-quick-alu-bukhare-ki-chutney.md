Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
