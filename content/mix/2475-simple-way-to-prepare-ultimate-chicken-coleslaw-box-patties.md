Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
