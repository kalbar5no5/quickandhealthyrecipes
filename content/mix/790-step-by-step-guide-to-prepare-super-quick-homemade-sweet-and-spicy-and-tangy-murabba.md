Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
