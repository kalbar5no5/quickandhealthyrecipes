Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
