Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
