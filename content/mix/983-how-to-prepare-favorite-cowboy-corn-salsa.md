Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
