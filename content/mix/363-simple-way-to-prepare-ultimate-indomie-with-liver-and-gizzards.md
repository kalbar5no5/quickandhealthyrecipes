It&#39;s now easier to find gizzard than liver, so I tried and it delivered. Adding gizzard by my taste palate is way better. This is the only way I can enjoy gizzard because I don&#39;t like them. Hearts, however, I would recommend no more than a month like this or just eat them fresh.

This is the only way I can enjoy gizzard because I don&#39;t like them. Hearts, however, I would recommend no more than a month like this or just eat them fresh. Just season ur gizzard like u would do for chicken stew. You can just cook it like chicken stew, or put less tinned tomatoes and add curry and bell peppers. It can be eaten with fried plantains, yams, rice, pasta, etc. good luck ðŸ™‚ Oge. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
