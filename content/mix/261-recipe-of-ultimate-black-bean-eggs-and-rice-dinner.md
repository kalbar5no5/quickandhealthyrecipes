Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
