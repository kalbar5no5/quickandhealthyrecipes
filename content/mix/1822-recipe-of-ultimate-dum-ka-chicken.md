Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
