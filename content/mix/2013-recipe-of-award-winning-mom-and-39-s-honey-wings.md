Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
