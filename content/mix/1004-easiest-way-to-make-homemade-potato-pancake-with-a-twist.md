Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
