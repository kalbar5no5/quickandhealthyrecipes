Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
