How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
