How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
