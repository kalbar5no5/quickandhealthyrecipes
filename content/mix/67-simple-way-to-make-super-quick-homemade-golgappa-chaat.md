Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
