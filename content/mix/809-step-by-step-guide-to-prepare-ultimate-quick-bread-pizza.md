Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
