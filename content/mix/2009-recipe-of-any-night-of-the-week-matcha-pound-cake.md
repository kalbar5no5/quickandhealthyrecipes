recipeingredient:
- "50 g butter"
- "50 g caster suger"
- "50 g self raising flour"
- "1 egg"
- "1/2 tea spoon matcha"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven on 170¬∞C. Prepare 50g room temperature butter is a bowl. Add 50g of caster sugar, and beat them until smooth. I used a wooden spoon since I don&#39;t have electronic mixer inn my kitchen. It&#39;s not so different and didn&#39;t take too much extra time and effort as long as the butter was at room temperature. You will want to achieve a matte finish."
- "Break an egg in a separate bowl, and measure only 50g to add to the mixture bowl. Mix the mixture with a silicon stapula."
- "Measure another 50 gram of self raising flour. Add to the mixture bowl batch by batch. You don&#39;t want to throw all the flour at once because that could make it hard to mix evenly. I added the flour in roughly 6 batches."
- "This is an optional step. I added 1/2 tea spoon of matcha powder. You can use chocolate power instead if you don&#39;t have matcha powder. That will turn the pound cake to chocolate flavour obviously. When it&#39;s mixed well, you are ready to pour them in the tin."
- "Prepare a baking tin brushed gently with butter and tear a layer of baking paper to the tin. Pour the mixture in the tin and make it even. Put the tin with mixture in oven at 170¬∞C for about 30 minutes."
- "Again this is optional but we sprinkled a bit more matcha powder on top of the cake before serve :)"

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
