Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
