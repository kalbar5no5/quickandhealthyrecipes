How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
