Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
