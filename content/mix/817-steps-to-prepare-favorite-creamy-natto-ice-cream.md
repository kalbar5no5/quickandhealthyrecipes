Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
