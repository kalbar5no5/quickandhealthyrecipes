Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
