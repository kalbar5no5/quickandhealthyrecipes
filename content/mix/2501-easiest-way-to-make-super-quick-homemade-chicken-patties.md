Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
