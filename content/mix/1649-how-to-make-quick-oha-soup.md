Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
