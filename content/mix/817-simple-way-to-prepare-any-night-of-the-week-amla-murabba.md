Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
