Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
