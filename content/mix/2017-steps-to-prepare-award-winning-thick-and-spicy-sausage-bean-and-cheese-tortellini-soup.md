Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
