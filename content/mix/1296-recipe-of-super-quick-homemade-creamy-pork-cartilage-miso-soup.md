Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
