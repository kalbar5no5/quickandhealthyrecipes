Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed.
