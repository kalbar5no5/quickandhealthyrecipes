Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
