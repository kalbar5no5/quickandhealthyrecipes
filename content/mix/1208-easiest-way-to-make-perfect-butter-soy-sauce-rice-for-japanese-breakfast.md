How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
