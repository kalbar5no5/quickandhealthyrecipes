Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
