Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
