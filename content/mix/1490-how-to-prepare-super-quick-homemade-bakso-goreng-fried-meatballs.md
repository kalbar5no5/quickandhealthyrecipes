Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
