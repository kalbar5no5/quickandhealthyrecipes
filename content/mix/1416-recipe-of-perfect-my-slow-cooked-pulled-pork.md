Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
