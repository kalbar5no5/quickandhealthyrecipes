Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
