- "250 grams Whole wheat flour finely milled"
- "180 ml Homemade natural leaven liquid"
- "1 tbsp Beet sugar cane sugar or your choice of sugar"
- "1 tsp Natural salt"
- "1 tbsp Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all of the ingredients in a bread machine, knead for about 10 minutes. Turn off the switch, gather the dough into a ball, put it in the bread maker, and reset the machine."
- "Put a damp towel over the bread maker and then, using the bread machine yeast-starter setting, slowly let the dough rise for 12 hours. Don&#39;t tightly wring out the towel."
- "When the dough rises 1.3 to 4 times in height, take it out, divide it into quarters, then roll each into a ball. Since the dough is firm, take care to make each surface smooth."
- "Make a deep cross cut into each rolls, arrange them on a baking tray, cover them with a tightly wrung damp cloth, then use the bread-rising setting of your oven for the second rising."
- "When the cuts start to open up, and the rolls have almost doubled in size, bake for 15-20 minutes at 200℃."
- "Feel free to use a seasonal yeast, or adjust the amount of liquid yeast to your liking. Unlike refined flours, the dough is firmer even after rising, but do not be concerned."
- "I recommend using finely milled whole wheat flour. The rolls will harden once cool, so warm them in a microwave or toaster."

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
