Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
