Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
