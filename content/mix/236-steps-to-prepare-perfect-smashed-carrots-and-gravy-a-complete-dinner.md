Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Rub skin of chicken with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Boston Market found a happy middle that proved to be just enough gravy to eat with the mashed potatoes without turning the meal into turkey stew. If there had been stuffing, this dinner could&#39;ve. Spread the mashed potatoes evenly in the bottom of the casserole. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
