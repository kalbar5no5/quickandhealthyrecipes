Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
