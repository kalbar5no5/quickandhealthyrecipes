Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
