Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
