Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
