Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
