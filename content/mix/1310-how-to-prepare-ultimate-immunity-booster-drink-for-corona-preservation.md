Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
