Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
