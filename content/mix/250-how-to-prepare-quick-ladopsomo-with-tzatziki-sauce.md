Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
