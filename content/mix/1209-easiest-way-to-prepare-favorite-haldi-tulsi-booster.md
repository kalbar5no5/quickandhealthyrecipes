Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
