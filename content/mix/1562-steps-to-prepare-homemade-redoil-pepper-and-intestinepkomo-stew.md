Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
