Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
