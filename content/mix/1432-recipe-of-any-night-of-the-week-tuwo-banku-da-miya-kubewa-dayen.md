Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
