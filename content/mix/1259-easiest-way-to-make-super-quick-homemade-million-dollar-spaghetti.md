Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
