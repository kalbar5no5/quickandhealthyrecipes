How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
