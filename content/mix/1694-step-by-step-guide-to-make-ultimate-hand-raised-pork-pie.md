Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
