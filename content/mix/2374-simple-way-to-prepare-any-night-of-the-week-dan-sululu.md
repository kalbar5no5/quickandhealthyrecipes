Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
