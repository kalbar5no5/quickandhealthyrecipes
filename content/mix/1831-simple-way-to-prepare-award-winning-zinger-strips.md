Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
