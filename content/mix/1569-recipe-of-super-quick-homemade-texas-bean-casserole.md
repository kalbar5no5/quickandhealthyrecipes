Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
