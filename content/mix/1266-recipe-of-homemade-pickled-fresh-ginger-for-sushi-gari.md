Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
