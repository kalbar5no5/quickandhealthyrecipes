Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
