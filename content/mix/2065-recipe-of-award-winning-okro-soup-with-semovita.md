Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
