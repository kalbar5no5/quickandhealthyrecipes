Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
