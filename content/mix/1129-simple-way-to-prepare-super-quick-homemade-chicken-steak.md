Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
