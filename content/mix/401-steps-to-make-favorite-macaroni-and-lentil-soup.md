We had lentils, it was not soup, but lentils cooked with tomatoes and served with macaroni…usually small elbow macaroni. Great recipe for Macaroni and Lentil Soup.

We had lentils, it was not soup, but lentils cooked with tomatoes and served with macaroni…usually small elbow macaroni. Great recipe for Macaroni and Lentil Soup. My friend gave me lentils, so I used them in a soup. There will be some liquid left when it&#39;s finished, but in the case that you let it simmer a long time and the macaroni absorbs the extra liquid, I think it would be best to continue heating it and add. Lentils are a wonderful food to stock in your pantry. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
