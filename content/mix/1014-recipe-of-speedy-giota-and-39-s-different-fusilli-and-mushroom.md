A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source.

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
