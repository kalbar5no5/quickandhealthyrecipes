Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
