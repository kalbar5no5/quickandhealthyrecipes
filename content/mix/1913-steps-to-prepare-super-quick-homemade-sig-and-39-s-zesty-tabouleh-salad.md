Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
