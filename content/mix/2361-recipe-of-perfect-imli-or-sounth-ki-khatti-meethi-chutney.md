How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
