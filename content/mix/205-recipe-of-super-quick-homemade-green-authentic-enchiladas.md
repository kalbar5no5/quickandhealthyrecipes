Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
