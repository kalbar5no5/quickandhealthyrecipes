Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
