Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
