Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
