Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
