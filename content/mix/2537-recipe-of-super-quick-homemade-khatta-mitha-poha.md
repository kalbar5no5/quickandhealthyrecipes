Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
