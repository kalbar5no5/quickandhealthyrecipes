Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
