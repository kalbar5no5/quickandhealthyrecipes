Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
