Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
