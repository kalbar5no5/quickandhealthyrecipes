Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
