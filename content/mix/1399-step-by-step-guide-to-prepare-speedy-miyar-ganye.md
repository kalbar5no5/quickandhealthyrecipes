Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
