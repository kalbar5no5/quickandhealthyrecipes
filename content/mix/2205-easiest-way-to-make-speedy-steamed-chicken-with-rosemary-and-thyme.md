Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
