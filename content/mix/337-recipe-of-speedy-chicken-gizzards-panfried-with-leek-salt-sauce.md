Place a handful of gizzards in flour baggie. Mix all ingredients in a large saucepan. Note: Do not boil or the gizzards will become dry and over cooked. &#34;You can never be surrounded by too many gizzards.&#34; More commonly sold than duck gizzards, chicken gizzards are dirt-cheap and wholly delicious.

Place gizzards into a medium saucepan, and cover with water by about an inch. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
