Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
