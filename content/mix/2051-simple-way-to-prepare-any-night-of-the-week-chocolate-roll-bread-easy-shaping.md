Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
