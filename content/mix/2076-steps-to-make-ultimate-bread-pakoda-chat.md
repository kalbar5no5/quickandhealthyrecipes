How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
