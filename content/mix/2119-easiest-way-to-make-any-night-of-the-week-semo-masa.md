Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
