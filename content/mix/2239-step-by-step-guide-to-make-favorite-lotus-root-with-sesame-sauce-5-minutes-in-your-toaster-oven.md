Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
