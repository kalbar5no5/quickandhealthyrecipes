Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
