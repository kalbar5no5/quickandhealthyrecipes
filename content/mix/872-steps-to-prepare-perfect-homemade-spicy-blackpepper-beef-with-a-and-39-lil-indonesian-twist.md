Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
