Hello everybody, hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, steakhouse salad w/ a1 dressing. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Whisk together mayonnaise, steak sauce, red wine vinegar, and cayenne pepper. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper. We&#39;ve combined perfectly juicy grilled ribeye steak with crunchy romaine lettuce, avocado slices, and all those tangy-sweet garden fresh tomatoes we&#39;re growing. What makes this steak salad really shine are the crispy french fried onions on top.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook steakhouse salad w/ a1 dressing using 14 ingredients and 11 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Steakhouse Salad w/ A1 Dressing:

1. Make ready 1 lb sirloin steak
1. Take 2 t applewood seasoning
1. Get 1 shallot; thin half moons
1. Take 6 mini bell peppers; thin half moons
1. Take 1 avocado; medium dice

End of season tomatoes are THE BEST, so here&#39;s a little inspiration for those last few weeks of summer when maybe the afternoon light has a slight slant to it, the sky is a little deeper blue, there&#39;s a hint of a chill in the air, but you&#39;ve still got the spirit of summer in you. If there&#39;s anything I love, it&#39;s a cold and crisp salad crowned with the perfect dressing. I like a dressing that isn&#39;t too creamy or too oily and one that has a perfect tang to it. Thin the dressing with up to a tablespoon of water, as needed.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
