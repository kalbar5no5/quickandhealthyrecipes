Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
