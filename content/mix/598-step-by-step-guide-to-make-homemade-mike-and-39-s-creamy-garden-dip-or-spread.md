Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
