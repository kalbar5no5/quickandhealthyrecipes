Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
