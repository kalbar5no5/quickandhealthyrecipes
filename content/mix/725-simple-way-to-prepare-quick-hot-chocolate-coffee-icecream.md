Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
