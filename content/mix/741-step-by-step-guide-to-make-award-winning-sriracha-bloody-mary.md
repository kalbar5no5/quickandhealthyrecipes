Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
