Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
