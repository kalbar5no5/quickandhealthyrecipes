Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
