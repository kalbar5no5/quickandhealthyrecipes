Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production.

Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier.
