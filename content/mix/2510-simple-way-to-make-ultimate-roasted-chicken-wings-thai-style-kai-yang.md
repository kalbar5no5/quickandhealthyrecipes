Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
