Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
