Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
