Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
