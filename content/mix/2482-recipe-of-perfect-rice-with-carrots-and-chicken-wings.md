Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
