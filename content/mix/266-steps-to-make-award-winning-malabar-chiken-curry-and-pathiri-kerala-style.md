Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
