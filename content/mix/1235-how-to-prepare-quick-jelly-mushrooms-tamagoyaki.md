A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
