Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
