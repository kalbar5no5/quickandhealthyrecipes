How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
