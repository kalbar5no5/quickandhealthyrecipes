Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
