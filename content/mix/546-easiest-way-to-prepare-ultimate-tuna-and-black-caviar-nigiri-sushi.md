Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
