recipeinstructions:
- "Red sauce: put oil, then add chopped onions and saute (don&#39;t brown them), then add tomatoes and cook. Once it&#39;s all cooked, add 1 jar of pasta sauce. Then add all chicken breasts. Once chicken is cooked, make sure you take it out and shred it with two forks, and then put the shredded chicken bag in while it cooks. Cook sauce for 3 hrs because you want to make sure that tomatoes are fully cooked. If cooked in pressure cooker or Crock-Pot/instapot, then can reduce the time to 30 to 40 minutes."
- "For white sauce: in a separate pan, add butter, add minced garlic and saute then add flour and salt and pepper and whisk. Once it has turned light brown, add milk while whisking. Add cream (you can skip this if you dont have cream), then cheese, keep whisking until it thickens. Add a pinch of nutmeg. Take it off of heat."
- "To make the layers, first put some oil in the pan. Then put 1 layer of red sauce. Then sprinkle grated mozzarella cheese, then put sheets of lasagna, then add white sauce and then cover with grated mozzarella cheese and then put another layer of lasagna sheets. Repeat until out of all sauce."
- "Bake in oven at 375 F for 30 minutes. Then broil for 1-2 minute to make sure the top cheese has a nice golden look. Be careful with broiling, it can burn the top, so keep watching it while it happens and take it out as soon as you think that the color of the cheese is good enough."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
