How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
