Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
