Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
