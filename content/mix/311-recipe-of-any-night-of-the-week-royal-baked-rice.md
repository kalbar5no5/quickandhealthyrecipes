Place cleaned rice in a pot to cook. Baked Rice is a foolproof method for getting fluffy, tender grains that have just the right texture. Combine rice, water, and butter and let it bake in the oven instead of on the stovetop. One of the reasons oven-baked rice turns out fabulous is that the heat is distributed more evenly throughout the cooking cycle. The rice should be tender but not mushy and all the liquid should be absorbed. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
