On a recent trip to San Francisco, I couldn&#39;t get enough of the legendary toast at The Mill, Josey Baker&#39;s place in the city&#39;s Western Addition. Place your slices of bread on a baking sheet. They may need a little longer if the bread was frozen when you started. For darker toast, leave the bread in a little longer, but don&#39;t let it burn.

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
