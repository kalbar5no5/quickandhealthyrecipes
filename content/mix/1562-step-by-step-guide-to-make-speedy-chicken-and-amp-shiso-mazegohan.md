Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
