Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
