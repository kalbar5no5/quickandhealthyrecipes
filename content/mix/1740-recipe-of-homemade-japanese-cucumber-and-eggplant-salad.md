Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
