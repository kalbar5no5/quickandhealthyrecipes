Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
