Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
