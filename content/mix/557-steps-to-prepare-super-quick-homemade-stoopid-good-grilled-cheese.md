Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
