- "2 tsp Milk"
- "2 tsp Vegetable oil"
- " Topping"

recipeinstructions:
- "[Matcha Sponge Cake] Line the bottom of a plastic container with cling film. You will cut the sponge cake later to fit into a cake pan, so you don&#39;t need to be precise about the size of the plastic container!"
- "Combine the cake flour and matcha. Put the sugar and egg in a bowl, and beat together. Whip in a double boiler. When it&#39;s warm to the touch, remove from the double boiler."
- "Keep whipping until it turns white and thick (until it drips like a ribbon when you lift the whisk). When the batter gets cold, put it back in a double  boiler."
- "Add the milk, and whip until it turns glossy. Sift in the dry ingredients, and fold in gently from the bottom using a rubber spatula."
- "Finally, add the vegetable oil and lightly mix it in. Pour the batter into the plastic container, and microwave for 1 minute at 600 W. If it&#39;s uncooked in the middle, microwave for a further 20 seconds."
- "Tightly cover the sponge cake with cling film while it&#39;s hot, and cover with a lid to cool. (By doing so, it will make the cake nice and moist.)"
- "Thinly slice the sponge cake, and cut it out into a circle using a cake pan. Or cut the sponge cake into pieces, and arrange them in the cake pan like a jigsaw puzzle."
- "[No-Bake Cheese Cake] Bring the cream cheese to room temperature. Add the condensed milk, and mix really well. Add the lemon juice, and mix until smooth."
- "Put the sweet azuki paste in a different bowl, add  a little less than half of the cream cheese from Step 8, and mix evenly."
- "Whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. You can whip the heavy cream very quickly if you use a secret trick from!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/144337-5-second-whipped-cream"
- "Add the heavy cream into the cheese cream from Step 8, and lightly mix together."
- "Combine the cheese cream and adzuki cream, and lightly mix together with the rubber spatula. It also looks good if you mix them together, not completely, to make a marble pattern."
- "Pour the batter into the cake pan, tap on a work surface a few times, and chill it overnight to let it set really well. (Since there is no gelatin in the cheese cake, it will take more than half a day to set.)"
- "Cover the side of the cake pan with a warm towel to remove the cake. Sprinkle matcha with a tea strainer right before you eat, serve with kuromitsu to taste, and enjoy."
- "It&#39;s tastier if you leave it for a whole day! The texture and taste will be even richer on the 2nd day. The sponge cake is so moist and you won&#39;t believe that it was made in the microwave!"
- "It&#39;s also delicious if you put store-bought matcha cookies at the bottom instead of the sponge cake. Try with 60 g of finely crushed cookies and 30 g of melted butter."

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
