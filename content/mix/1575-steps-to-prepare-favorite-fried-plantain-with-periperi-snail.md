Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
