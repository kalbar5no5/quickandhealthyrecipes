Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
