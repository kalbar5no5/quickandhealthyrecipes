How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
