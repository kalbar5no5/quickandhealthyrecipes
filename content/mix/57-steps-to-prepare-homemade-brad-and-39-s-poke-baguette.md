Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
