How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
