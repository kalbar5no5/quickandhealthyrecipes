How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
