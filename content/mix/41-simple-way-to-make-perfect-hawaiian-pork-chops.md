Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
