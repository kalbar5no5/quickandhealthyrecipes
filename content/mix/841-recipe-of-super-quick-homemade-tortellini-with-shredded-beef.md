Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
