Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
