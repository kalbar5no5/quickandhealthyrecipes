Homemade meatballs and tomato sauce are what make these cheesy sliders stand out. Meatballs are simple to make, but the key to success is not over-working the meat. Use high-quality brioche buns if you can find them since they add a nice light sweetness and a finished look. We love the King&#39;s Hawaiian Roll brand for making sliders and our favorite flavors are original Hawaiian Sweet and Savory Butter. You can also use homemade dinner rolls. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
