Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
