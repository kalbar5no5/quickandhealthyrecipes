Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
