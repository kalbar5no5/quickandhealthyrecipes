Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
