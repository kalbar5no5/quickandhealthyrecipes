Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
