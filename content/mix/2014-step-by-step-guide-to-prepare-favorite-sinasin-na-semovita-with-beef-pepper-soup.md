Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
