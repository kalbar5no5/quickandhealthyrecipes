Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
