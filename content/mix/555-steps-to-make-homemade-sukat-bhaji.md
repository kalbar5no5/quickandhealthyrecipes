Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
