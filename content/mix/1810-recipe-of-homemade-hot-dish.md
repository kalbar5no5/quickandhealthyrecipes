Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
