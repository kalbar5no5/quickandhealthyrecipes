(Image credit: Emma Christensen) Delia&#39;s Wholemeal Loaf recipe. The poet Pam Ayres once said, when describing her home-made wholemeal bread, that it was like &#39;biting into a cornfield&#39;, and that&#39;s it - the very best description I&#39;ve ever come across. A crisp, crunchy crust and then all the flavour of the wholewheat grain - take a bite, close your eyes and you&#39;ll know just what she meant.

The poet Pam Ayres once said, when describing her home-made wholemeal bread, that it was like &#39;biting into a cornfield&#39;, and that&#39;s it - the very best description I&#39;ve ever come across. A crisp, crunchy crust and then all the flavour of the wholewheat grain - take a bite, close your eyes and you&#39;ll know just what she meant. Besides just eating it warm from the oven, this homemade bread can be enjoyed in so many ways. It&#39;s perfect for sandwiches, because of it&#39;s soft, pillow-y texture. I love to slather it with butter and give it a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar, or a swipe of jam. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
