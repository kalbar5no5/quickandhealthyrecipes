Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
