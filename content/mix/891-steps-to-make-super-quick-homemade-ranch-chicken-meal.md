Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
