Delicious strong flavours here with the octopus and mushrooms. Come preparare le linguine con rag√π di polpo Pulite il polpo: aprite la testa ed eliminate il becco centrale e le interiora. Ho sempre preparato il polpo in bianco: o a insalata, o a carpaccio, o arrostito. Questa volta ho voluto provare a trattarlo pi√π da calamaro che da polpo, e l&#39;ho tuffato nella passata di pomodoro. In una pentola capiente mettere una cipolla tagliata a fette, due spicchi d&#39;aglio, la vernaccia e il prezzemolo, quindi riempire fino a tre quarti con l&#39;acqua. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
