Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
