Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
