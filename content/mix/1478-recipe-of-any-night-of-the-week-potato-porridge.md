In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished!
