recipeingredient:
- "2 1/2 lb ground meat i say meat because i use a 5050 blend of beef and venison ground meat"
- "2 can campbells cheddar cheese soup"
- "1 can campbells garlic cream of mushroom soup"
- "1 can sliced mushrooms large can not the half can"
- "1/2 quart sliced dill pickles"
- "1 can diced tomato"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook ground meat, and can of mushrooms, but season it to taste like you would a burger."
- "While the ground meat is cooking, start your soups in a large pot, mix in two cans cheddar, and one can cream of mushroom, and three cans of water (milk changes the flavor too much for me, you can use 2 cans of it in place of the water as directed on the cheese soup if you like)"
- "Next open and drain the diced tomato."
- "Take the 1/2 jar of pickles and give them a bath in a bowl of hot water. Drain and rinse a few times while the soup is thinning out and the meat is cooking. This will dilute the strong taste of the pickles and prevent it from overpowering the other flavors when added to the soup. Chop the pickles before adding them."
- "When the meat is done strain off any grease using a colander lined with paper towel. Then add it to the soup along with the diced tomato, and pickle. Simmer on low for about a half hour or until the pickles soften."

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
