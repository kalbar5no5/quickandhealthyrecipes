Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
