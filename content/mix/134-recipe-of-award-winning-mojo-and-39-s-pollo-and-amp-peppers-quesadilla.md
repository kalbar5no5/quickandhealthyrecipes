Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
