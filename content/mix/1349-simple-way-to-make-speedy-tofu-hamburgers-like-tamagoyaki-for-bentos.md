Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
