Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
