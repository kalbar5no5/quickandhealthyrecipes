Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
