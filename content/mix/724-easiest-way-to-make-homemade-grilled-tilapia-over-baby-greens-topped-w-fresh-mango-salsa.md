Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
