Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
