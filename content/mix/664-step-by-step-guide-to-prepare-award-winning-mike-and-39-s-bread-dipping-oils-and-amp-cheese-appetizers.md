If you are like us - when you sit down at a nice Italian restaurant you can&#39;t wait for them to bring the warm bread and dipping oil. The main difference is between regular olive oil and extra-virgin olive oil. Regular olive oil (also called &#34;pure olive oil&#34;) has a higher smoke point, which makes it ideal for cooking and baking. This oil is processed to remove any impurities, which is why it typically has a lighter color. Recipes include Italian Bread Dipping Oil, Garlic Bread Dip, Tuscan Herb, Herb de Provence and Restaurant Style Dipping Oil. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
