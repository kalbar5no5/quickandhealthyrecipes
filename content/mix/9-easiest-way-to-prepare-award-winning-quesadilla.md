Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
