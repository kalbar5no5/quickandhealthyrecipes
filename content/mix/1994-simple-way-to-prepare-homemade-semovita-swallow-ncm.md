Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
