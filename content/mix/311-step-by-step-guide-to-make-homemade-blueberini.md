Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
