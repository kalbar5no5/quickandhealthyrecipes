Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
