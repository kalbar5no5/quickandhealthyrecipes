Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
