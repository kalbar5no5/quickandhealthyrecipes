How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
