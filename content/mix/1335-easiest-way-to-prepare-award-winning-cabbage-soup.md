Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
