Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
