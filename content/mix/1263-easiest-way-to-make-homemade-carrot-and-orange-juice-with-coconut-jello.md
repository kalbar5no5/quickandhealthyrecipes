Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
