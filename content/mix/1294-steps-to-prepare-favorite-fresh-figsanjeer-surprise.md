Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel).

Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.
