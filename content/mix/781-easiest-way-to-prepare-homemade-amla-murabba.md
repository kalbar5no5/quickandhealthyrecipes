Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
