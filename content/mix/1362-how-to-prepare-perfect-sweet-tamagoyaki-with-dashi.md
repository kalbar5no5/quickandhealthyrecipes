Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
