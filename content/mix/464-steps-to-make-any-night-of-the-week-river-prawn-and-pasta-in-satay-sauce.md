Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
