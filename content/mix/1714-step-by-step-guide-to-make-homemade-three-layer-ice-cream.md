Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
