Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
