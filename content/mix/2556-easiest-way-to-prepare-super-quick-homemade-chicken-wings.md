Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
