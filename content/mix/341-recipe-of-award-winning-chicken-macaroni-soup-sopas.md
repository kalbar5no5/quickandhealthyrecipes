Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
