Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!
