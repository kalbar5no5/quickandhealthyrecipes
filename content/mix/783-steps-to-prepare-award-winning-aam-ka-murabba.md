Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
