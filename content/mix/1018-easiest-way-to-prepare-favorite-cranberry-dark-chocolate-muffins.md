Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
