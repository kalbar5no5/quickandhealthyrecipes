Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
