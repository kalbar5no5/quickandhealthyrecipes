Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
