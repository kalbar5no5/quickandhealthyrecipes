Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
