How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
