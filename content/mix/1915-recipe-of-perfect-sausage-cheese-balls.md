Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
