Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
