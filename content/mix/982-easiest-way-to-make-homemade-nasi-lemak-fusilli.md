Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
