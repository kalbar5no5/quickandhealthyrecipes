Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
