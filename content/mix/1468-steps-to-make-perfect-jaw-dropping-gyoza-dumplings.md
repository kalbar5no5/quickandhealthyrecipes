recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the garlic chives and cabbage leaves roughly. Chop the ginger and garlic finely. Combine these vegetables with the minced pork in a bowl."
- "Add all the seasonings and mix well for about 5 minutes until the mixture becomes slightly sticky. Leave to rest at room temperature."
- "How to make gyoza dumpling skins. Put the flour into a bowl and pour in boiling water. Mix roughly with chopsticks. When the dough is cooled down enough to handle, knead the dough for about five minutes until it becomes elastic and smooth."
- "Divide the smooth dough into two and wrap in cling film. Leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes."

- "Wet the edges of the round skin and stuff with the filling, sealing the folded skin together."
- "When you fry half the gyoza. Heat the frying pan over high heat. Put two tablespoons of vegetable oil and place in the gyoza dumplings. Pour over 100 ml of hot water and cover. Fry for about five minutes over high heat."
- "After 5 minutes, all the water should have almost evaporated, so drizzle oil on the side of the frying pan. Fry until the gyoza are golden brown, then serve."
- "P.S.: When you want to have really crispy gyoza, you can make these changes to the gyoza skin recipe:   1 and 1/2 cup of plain flour.  1/2 cup of strong (bread) flour.  150 ml of boiling water.  Dumplings made like this are really tasty, too."

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
