Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
