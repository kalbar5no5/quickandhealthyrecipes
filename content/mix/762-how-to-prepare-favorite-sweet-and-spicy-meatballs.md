Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
