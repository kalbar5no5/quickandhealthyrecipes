How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
