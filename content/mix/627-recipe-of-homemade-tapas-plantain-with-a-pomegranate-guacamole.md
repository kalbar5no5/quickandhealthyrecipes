Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
