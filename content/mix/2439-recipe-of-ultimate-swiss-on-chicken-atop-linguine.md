Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
