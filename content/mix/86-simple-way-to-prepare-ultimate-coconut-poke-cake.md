Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
