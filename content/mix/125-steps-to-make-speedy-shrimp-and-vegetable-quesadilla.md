Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
