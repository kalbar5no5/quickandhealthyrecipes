Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body.
