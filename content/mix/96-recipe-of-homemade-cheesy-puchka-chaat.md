Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
