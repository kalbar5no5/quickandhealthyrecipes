Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
