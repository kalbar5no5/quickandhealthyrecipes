Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
