Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
