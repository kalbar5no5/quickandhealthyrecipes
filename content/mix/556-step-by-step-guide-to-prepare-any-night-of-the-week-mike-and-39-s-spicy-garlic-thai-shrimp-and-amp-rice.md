Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
