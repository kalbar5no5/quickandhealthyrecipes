recipeinstructions:

- "Heat the veg you have just chopped on a low heat for 5-10 mins until they start to soften, but before they start to colour. Take off heat once this is done."

- "At this point you have two choices. If you like chunky soup, leave as it is. If you want a smooth texture add the soup to a bowl and blitz with a hand blender. If you want a creamy soup, add the cream after blending - leave a little to swirl on the top if you like. Have a taste and add more pepper if needed. Enjoy with sourdough bread and cheddar cheese!"

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
