Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
