Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
