- "60 grams Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Measure out all of the ingredients. Please put the egg yolks and egg white into separate bowls."
- "Measure the cake flour and matcha into the same bowl  and mix with an egg beater."
- "Add a bit of sugar to the egg yolks (about 10 g), and mix until white."
- "Add in the milk and stir some more."
- "Add in the powdered ingredients at the same time, and gently mix until the flouriness is gone."
- "This is what it should look like after mixing. It looks like pancake mix. Heat up the oven once you get this far."
- "Whip the egg whites on high speed with a hand mixer. Do so at first without adding anything in."
- "After it has whipped up a bit, add in the remaining sugar from step 3 in over 2-3 batches, and thoroughly whip until it shines."
- "Whip the egg whites for an additional three minutes once you reach the point where you think it&#39;s good enough. Whip for an additional three minutes on a low speed after that for a proper meringue."
- "Add 1/3 of the meringue to step 6, and mix until it blends together smoothly with an egg beater."
- "Add in half of the remaining meringue, and this time scoop up the batter from the bottom to the top with a rubber spatula while turning the bowl, and fold it onto it self in a cutting manner."
- "Mix in the remaining meringue in the same manner. A nicely mixed batter will have a shine."
- "Pour the completed batter all at once into the cake pain from above, and hit the bottom of the pan 2-3 times while holding onto the center to remove the air."
- "Bake in an oven at 170-180°C for 45 minutes. Use 170°C for an oven with a strong heat, and please set it at 180°C if it is weaker."
- "The cake will crack; let the crack turn golden brown, and cover with aluminum foil if it looks like it will burn more than that."
- "Take it out of the oven immediately after baking, and flip it upside down immediately onto a bottle or mug cup to cool."
- "Cover with a plastic bag once the residual heat subsides, and it will become rich and delicious."
- "Press down on it firmly at first around the edges and center of the pan when taking it out, lift the center up, and carefully remove it from the bottom of the pan."
- "It feels really good if you can take it out cleanly. It&#39;s definitely worth a shot."
- "I topped it with dainagon adzuki beans this time."

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
