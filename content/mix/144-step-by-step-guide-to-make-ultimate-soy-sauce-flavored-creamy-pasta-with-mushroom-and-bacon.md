Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
