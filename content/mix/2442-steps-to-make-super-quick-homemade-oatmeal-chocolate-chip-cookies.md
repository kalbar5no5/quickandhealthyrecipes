Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
