Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
