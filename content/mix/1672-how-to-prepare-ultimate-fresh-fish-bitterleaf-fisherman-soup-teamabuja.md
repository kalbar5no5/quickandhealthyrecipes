Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
