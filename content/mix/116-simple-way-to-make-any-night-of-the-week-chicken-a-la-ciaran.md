Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
