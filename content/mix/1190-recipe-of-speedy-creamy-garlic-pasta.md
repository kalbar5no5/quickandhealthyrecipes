Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
