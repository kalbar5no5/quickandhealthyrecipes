Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
