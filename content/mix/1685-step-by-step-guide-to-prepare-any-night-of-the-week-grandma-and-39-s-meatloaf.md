Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
