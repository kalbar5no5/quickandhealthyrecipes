Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
