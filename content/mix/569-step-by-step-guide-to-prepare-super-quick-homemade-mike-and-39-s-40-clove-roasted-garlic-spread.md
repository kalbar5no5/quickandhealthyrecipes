Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
