A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
