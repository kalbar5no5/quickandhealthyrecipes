Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
