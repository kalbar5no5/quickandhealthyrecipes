Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
