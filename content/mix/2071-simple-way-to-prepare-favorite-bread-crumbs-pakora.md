I coated the eggplant first with some chickpea flour, before dipping it in the batter and Panko. Panko are Japanese breadcrumbs which give you the most crunch, but you can use any bread crumbs that you have. Then I shallow fried the pakoras until crisp and browned. Hi, In one episode of Nigella&#39;s TV programme (I think Nigella Bites) I remember Nigella showing us that she always keeps a supply of breadcrumbs stashed in the deep freeze. I was just wondering if the breadcrumbs need to be defrosted before using - I&#39;m fairly sure she said they didn&#39;t but I&#39;m finding that they never really crisp up properly if you cook them from frozen (either in a pan or for. 

Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
