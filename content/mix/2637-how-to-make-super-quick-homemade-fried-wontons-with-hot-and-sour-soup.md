Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
