Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
