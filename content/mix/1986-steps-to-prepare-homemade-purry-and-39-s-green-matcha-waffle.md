Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
