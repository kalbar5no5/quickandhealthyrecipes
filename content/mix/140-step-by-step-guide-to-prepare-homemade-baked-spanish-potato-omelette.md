Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
