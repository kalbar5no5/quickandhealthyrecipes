Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!
