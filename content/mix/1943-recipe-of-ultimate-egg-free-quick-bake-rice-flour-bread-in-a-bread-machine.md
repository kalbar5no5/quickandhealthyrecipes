Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
