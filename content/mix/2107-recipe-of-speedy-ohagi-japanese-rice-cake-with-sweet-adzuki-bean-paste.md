How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
