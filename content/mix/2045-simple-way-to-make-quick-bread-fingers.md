How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
