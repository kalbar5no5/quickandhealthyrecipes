Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
