Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
