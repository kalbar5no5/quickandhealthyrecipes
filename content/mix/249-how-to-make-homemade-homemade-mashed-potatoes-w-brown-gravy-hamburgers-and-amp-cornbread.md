Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
