Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
