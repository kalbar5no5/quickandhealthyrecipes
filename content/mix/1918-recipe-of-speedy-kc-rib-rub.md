Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
