Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
