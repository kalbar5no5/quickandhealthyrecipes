Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
