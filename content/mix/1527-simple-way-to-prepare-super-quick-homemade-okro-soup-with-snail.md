Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
