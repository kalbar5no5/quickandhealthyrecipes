Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
