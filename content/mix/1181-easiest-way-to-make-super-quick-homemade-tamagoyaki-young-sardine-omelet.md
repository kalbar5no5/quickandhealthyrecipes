Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood.

These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving!
