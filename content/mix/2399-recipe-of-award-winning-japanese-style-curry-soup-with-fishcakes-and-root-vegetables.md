How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
