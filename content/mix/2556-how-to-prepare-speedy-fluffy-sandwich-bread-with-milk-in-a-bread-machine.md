recipeingredient:
- "210 grams Milk"
- "250 grams Strong bread flour"
- "30 grams Sugar"
- "3 grams Dry yeast"
- "3 grams Salt"
- "20 grams Butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the case for your bread maker on a scale and pour in the milk. Measure out the other ingredients and add them in. Set the dough either on the soft bread or golden brown setting, and let it make the dough."
- "You can also make a low fat version. The bread will brown easily (especially with the chocolate version), so use the Sweet Bread setting if your machine has it."
- "If you don&#39;t take it out quickly, it will burn and become hard! If the crust and top burn too much, try taking the bread out 5 to 8 minutes before the baking course ends."
- "Once it has cooled down, store in a bag so it doesn&#39;t dry out. If possible, slice the bread when you need it. Don&#39;t slice it all in the beginning."
- "Marble Chocolate Version: At the mix call, add in 8 pieces of chocolate. According to the kind of chocolate bar and the timing, it might turn out as chocolate bread. I suppose it depends on your machine!"
- "Chocolate Sandwich Bread Substitute 20-30 of the 250 g of bread flour with cocoa powder. You can also use matcha, etc."
- "Cheese Sandwich Bread Add in 1-4 slices of cheese. You can either do this at the mix call or at the beginning. The dough will rise really high! You can also add in cubed cheese at the end."
- "Hot Sandwiches Chocolate Banana Cheese Sandwiches are the best!"
- "For a healthier version: Substitute soy milk for the milk, the sweetener for the sugar, reduce the salt to 2 g, and use 15 g of transfat free shortening for the grease."
- "Flour 270 g: Milk 220 g, Bread flour 270 g, Sugar 32 g, Yeast 3.2 g, Salt 3.2 g, Butter 21 g."
- "Flour 300 g: Milk 250 g, Bread flour 300 g, Sugar 36 g, Yeast 3.6 g, Salt 3.6 g, Butter 24 g."
- "Flour 350 g: Milk 290 g, Bread flour 350 g, Sugar 42 g, Yeast 4.2 g, Salt 4.2 g, Butter 28 g."
- "Is the Forever Fluffy Shaped Bread.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143948-always-soft-basic-bread-dough"
- "Lately I have been using a new Bread Machine. With the regular course, the dough rises too fast, creates a depression, and bakes too fast. Maybe I was putting in 38 g of sugar?"
- "Instead of salt, you can use 18 grams of shio-koji!  It&#39;s stays fluffy, and it seems like it&#39;s even a bit sweeter this way."
- "This is something that&#39;s been a big hit lately. I&#39;ve been using 100% veggie juice!! Half veggie juice and half soy milk is also just as good. I love it."

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
