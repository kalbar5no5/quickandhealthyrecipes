Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
