Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
