Today i am going to talk briefly about the Calories in Semovita, so you can adjust and d your calculations when you are planning your meals. Semolina is a high-gluten flour made from hard durum wheat. It has a rather coarse texture, yellow color, and is high in gluten protein. The high gluten content means the flour is especially well suited for making pasta, but this flour is also a common ingredient in bread and baked goods as well as couscous.

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
