Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
