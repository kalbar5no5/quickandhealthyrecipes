Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
