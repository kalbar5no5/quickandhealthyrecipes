Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
