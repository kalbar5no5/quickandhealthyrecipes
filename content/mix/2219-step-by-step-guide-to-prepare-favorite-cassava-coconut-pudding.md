Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
