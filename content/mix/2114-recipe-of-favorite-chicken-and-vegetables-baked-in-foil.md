Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
