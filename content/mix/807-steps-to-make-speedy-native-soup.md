Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
