Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
