Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
