Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
