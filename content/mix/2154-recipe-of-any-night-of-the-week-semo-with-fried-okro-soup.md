Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
