Turai is disliked by many of us due to its unusual appearance. It is actually one of those vegetables that absorbs other flavours beautifully and has been made more delicious and nutritious by addition it to moong dal. Moong dal is one of the easiest dals to digest and also provides plenty of proteins and iron. Boil chana dal till it is soft but not mushy.

Moong dal is one of the easiest dals to digest and also provides plenty of proteins and iron. Boil chana dal till it is soft but not mushy. When all the steam gets released opens the lid and keeps aside. Turai chana Turai also known as turiya, tori, beerakai, dodka, luffa or ridge gourd in english is a common summer vegetable. This dark green colored vegetable has tapered ends and thick skin with soft white flesh in between. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
