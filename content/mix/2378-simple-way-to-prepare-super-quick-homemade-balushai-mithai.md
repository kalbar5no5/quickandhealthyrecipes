Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
