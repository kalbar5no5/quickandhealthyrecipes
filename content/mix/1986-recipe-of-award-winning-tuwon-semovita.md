Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
