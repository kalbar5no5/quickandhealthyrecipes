Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
