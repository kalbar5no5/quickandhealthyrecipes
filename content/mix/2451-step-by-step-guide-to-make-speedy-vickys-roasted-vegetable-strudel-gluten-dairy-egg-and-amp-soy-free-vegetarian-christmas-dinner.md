Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
