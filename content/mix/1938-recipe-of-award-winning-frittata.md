How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
