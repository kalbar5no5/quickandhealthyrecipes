Remove from heat and set aside. Year after year, my Thanksgiving table is typically vegetarian except for the turkey, and some years I don&#39;t even make a turkey. The one dish that I struggled with for years was gravy. Since all my side dishes on my menu are vegetarian, it seems strange to have a meat based gravy.

The one dish that I struggled with for years was gravy. Since all my side dishes on my menu are vegetarian, it seems strange to have a meat based gravy. Golden-hued chanterelle mushrooms, abundant in the fall, are buttery-rich in flavor and perfume any dish with a lovely, woodsy scent. They are a perfect addition to our dressed-up gravy. Gravy is a sauce made by thickening meat-based stocks and/or the drippings from roasts with a roux made from flour and some kind of fat (often butter, though you could use oil or the fat collected from the roast itself). 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
