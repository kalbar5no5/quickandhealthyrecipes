Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
