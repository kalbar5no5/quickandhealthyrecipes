Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
