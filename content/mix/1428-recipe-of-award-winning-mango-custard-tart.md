Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
