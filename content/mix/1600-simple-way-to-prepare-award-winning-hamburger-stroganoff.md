Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
