Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
