Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
