Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
