Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
