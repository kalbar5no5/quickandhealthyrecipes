Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
