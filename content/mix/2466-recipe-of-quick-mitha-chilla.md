Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
