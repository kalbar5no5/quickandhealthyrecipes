Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
