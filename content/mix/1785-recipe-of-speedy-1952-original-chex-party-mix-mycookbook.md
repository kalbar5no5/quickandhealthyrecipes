Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
