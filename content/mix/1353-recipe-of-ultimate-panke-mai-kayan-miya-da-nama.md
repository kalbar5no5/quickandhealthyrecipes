Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
