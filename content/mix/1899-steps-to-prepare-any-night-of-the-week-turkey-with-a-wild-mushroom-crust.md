Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
