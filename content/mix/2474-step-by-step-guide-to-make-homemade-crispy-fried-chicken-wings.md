Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
