Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
