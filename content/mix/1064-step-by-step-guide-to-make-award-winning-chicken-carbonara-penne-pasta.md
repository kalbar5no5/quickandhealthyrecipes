Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
