Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
