Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
