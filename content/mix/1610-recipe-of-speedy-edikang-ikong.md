Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
