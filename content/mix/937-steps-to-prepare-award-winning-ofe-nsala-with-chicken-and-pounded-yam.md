Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
