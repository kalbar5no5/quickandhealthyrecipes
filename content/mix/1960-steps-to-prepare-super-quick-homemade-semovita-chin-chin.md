Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
