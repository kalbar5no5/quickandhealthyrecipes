How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
