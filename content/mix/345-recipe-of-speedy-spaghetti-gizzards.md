How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
