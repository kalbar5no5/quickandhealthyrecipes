Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood.

Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them.
