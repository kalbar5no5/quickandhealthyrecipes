It has a rich texture of cream and a fine taste of spices Turkey RecipesNew RecipesDinner RecipesCooking RecipesHealthy RecipesRecipiesSour Cream Recipes DinnerCooking GadgetsVegetarian Recipes This is a simple home version of butter chicken, also known as &#39;murgh&#39; or &#39;chicken makhani,&#39; a popular dish in Indian restaurants. This is best served with naan, an Indian bread, or you can also serve this with basmati rice. One of the things I missed most when I started the autoimmune protocol was spicy, tomatoey ethnic food-whether it was salsa, jambalaya, or tikka masala, I was devastated to think I couldn&#39;t eat those things anymore and might not be able to ever again if reintroducing those spices. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
