Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
