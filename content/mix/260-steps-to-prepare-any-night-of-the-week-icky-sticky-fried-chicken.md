How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
