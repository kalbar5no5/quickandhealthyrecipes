Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
