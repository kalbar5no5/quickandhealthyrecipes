Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
