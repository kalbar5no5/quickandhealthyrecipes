Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
