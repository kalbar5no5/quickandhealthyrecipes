Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
