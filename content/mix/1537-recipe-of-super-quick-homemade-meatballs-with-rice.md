Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
