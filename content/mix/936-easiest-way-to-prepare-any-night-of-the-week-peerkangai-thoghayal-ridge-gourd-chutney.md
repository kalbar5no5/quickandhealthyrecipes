Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
