Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
