The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest.
