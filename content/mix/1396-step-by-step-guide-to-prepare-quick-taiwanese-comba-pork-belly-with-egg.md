Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
