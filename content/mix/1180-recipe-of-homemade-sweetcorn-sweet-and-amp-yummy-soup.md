Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
