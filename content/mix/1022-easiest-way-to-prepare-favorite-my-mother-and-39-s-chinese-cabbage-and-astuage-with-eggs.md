Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
