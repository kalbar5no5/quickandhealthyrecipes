Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood.
