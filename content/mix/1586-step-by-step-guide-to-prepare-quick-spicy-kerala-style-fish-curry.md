Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
