Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process.
