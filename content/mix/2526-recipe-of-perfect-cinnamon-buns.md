Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
