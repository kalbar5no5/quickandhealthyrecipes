Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
