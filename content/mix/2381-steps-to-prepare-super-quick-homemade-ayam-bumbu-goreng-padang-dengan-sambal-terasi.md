Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
