BLT sandwiches are so good, but they can make a lot of messy crumbs from the toasted bread. Since we also love wraps, I decided to make BLT&#39;s using tortillas instead. Warming the wraps a little makes them easy to work with. 

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
