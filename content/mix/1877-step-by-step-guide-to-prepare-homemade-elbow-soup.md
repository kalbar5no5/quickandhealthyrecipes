Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
