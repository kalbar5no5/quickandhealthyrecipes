Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
