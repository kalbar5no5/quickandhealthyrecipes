Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
