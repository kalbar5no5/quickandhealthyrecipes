Made with simple ingredients: ground beef, canned tomatoes and macaroni. GRANDMA&#39;S AMERICAN GOULASH (GROUND BEEF) We call this recipe &#34;American Goulash&#34; because even though it is called goulash, it&#39;s not the Hungarian version with paprika and whole cuts of meat. Originally hailing from medieval Hungary, goulash was a common dish prepared by cowboys and herdsmen in the regionâ€”so you know it&#39;s bound to be a hearty and filling meal. Fry hamburger, pepper, and onion in large skillet. Drain fat if needed (if you&#39;re not sure, you can also only cook the macaroni part way so that while simmering the uncooked pasta will soak up excess moisture when added to the mixture).
