Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
