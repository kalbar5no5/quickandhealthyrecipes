Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
