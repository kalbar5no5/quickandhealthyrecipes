Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
