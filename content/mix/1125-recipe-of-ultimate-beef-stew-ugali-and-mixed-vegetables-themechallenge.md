This delicious and satisfying beef stew recipe is flavored with tomatoes and red wine, along with beef broth and vegetables. Flavored with red wine and chopped vegetables, this stew is a tasty and easy family meal. A classic Kenyan beef stew accompanied with properly cooked Ugali is everyone&#39;s favourite. My method is one that results in beautifully cooked tender meat, however, you may some times purchase meat that is hard and needs to be boiled before adding to the pot. Almost any beef stew can host a handful or two of mushrooms with ease. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
