Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
