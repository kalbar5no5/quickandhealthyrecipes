recipeinstructions:
- "I use mild vinegar but use less than listed if using normal vinegar."

New Year&#39;s Eve dinner is the time for the family to get together and enjoy food and the Chinese New Year Gala. My parents always made a few salad dishes for this special event, and this carrot, cucumber and glass noodle salad is a must. These noodles are believed to have originated in China, but yam wun sen, a spicy Thai salad made with glass noodles, pork, and prawns, is one of the most notable versions of the salad. Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese cuisines also have their own glass noodle salads, and &#34;Asian-inspired&#34; cuisine found in Western countries may create hybrid. Vermicelli noodles (Cellophane noodles)are also known as glass noodles in Chinese. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
