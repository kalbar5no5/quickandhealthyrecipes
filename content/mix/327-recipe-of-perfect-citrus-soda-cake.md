Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
