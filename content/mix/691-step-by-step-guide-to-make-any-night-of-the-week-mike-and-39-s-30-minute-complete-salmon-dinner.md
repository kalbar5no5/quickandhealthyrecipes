Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
