Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
