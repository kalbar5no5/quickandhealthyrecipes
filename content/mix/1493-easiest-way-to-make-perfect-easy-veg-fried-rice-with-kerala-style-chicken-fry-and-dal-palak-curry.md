Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
