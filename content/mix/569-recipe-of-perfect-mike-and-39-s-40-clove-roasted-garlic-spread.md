Bake until golden brown and fork-tender, stirring halfway through cooking. First, using a sharp knife, slice ¼ inch off the top of a whole head of garlic to expose the individual cloves. (Hint: Find the root of the bulb and cut off the opposite end of the head. Similar to chopping an onion, always leave the root in-tact.) We&#39;re talking about whole heads of garlic roasted with olive oil until each individual clove is completely golden and butter-soft — perfect for spreading on a spare piece of baguette or mashing into a salad dressing. Perfect, really, for just about anything. I finally tried out the olive bar at the grocery store today and got a bunch of stuff including roasted garlic cloves. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
