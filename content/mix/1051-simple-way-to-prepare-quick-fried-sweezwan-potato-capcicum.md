Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body.
