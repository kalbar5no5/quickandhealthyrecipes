Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
