Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
