How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
