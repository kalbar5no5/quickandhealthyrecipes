Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
