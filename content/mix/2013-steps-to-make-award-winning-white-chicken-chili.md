How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
