Crisp yet tender with bursts of sweet and savory flavors, Kinpira Renkon, or Japanese Lotus Root Stir Fry, is a classic home-cooked side dish. One of the reasons I love about Japanese home-cooked meals is that root vegetables are used in a whole range of dishes. From gobo (burdock root), renkon (lotus root), satoimo (taro root), daikon radish. In a medium sauce pan, mix together coconut aminos or soy sauce, sugar, arrowroot, ginger, lime juice, and garlic and simmer and cool.

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
