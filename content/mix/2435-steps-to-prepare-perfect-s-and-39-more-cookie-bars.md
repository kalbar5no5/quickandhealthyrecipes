Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
