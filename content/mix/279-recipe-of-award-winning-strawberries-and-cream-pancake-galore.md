Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
