Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
