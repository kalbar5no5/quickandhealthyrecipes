Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
