Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
