Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
