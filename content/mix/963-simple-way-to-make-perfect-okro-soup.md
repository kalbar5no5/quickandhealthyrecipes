Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
