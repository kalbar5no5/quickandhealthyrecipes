Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
