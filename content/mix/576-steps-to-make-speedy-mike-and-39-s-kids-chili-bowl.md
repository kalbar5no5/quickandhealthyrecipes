Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
