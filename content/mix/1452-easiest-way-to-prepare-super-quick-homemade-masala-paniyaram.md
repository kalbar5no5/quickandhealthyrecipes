Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
