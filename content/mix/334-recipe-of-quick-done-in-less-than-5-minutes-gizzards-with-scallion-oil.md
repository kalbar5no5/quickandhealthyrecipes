Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
