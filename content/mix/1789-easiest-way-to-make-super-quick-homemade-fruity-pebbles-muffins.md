Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
