- "After this second proofing, use a tea strainer to sprinkle some bread flour over the top of the dough and score it 4 times. Spray with water and bake in an oven preheated to 220°C for 22 minutes. The outside of the bread may burn easily so if it looks like it is browning too much, cover it with aluminium foil whilst baking."

- "You can use this recipe to make 2 small loaves as well."
- "Here I tried making a loaf with no filling. I proved it for a second time in a banneton (a bread rising mould) and dusted with rye flour. It made a really soft loaf that&#39;s great for making sandwiches."

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
