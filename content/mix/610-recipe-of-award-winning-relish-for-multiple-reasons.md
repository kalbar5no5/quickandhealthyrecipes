Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
