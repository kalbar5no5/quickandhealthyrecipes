How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
