Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!
