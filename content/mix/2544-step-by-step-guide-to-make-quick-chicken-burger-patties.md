Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
