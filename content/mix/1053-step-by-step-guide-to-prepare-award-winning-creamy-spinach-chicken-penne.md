Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
