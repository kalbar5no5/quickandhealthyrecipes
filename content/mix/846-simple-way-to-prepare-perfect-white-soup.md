How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
