Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
