How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
