Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
