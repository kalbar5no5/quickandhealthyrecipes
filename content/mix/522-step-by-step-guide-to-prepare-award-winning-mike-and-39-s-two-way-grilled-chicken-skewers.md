Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
