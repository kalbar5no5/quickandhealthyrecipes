Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
