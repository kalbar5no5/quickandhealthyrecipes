How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
