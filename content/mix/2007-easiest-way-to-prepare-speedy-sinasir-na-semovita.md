Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
