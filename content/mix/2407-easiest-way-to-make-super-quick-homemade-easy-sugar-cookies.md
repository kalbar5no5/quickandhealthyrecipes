Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
