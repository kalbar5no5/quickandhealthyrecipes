Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
