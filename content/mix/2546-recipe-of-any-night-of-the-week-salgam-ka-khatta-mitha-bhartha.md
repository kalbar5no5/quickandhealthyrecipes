Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
