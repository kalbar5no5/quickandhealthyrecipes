Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
