- "2 teaspoons paprika"
- "1.5 teaspoons garlic powder not garlic salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- " Other"
- " vegetable or peanut oil for frying"
- " tongs for turning chicken safely"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all brine ingredients in a large bowl and stir or whisk until all the salt and sugar have been dissolved."
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken with yogurt brine and gently toss and massage everything together until the brine is evenly distributed throughout. It&#39;s a good idea to check each individual piece of chicken to ensure it&#39;s been thoroughly coated."
- "Refrigerate the chicken and let it brine/marinate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours."
- "45 minutes before frying, take the chicken out of the fridge and let it come up in temperature. While it&#39;s doing that, prepare the dredge by combining all dredge ingredients in a large mixing bowl or casserole dish and stirring or whisking several times to evenly distribute all the seasonings."
- "10 to 15 minutes before frying, fill your large pot or pan (I like to use my wok, but you can use a Dutch or French oven, or a deep-ish cast iron skillet) to about 2/3 capacity with frying oil and preheat the oil over medium high heat to 350F to 365F. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, you&#39;ll know the oil is ready for frying as soon as a good pinch of flour dropped in sizzles gently but immediately."
- "Line a sheet pan or large platter with a brown paper bag or a double layer of paper towels and set it on the counter next to the stove."
- "Working in batches of 3 to 4 pieces, coat the chicken completely with the dredge, shake off the excess, and gently slide the chicken into your oil. And again, if that flour doesn&#39;t begin to gently and immediately sizzle upon hitting that oil, resist the urge to let it fry anyway, and let the oil come up in temp before you put the chicken in."
- "I like to put similarly sized/same type pieces in together, largest ones first. That way, a) each batch finishes cooking at roughly the same time and b) the larger pieces that have been fried first will retain heat longer while the smaller pieces are finishing up."
- "Generally speaking, I find that thighs take longest - 15 to 18 minutes total, 7.5 to 9 minutes per side, and drums, whole wings, and breast pieces take 12 to 15 minutes total, 6 to 7.5 minutes per side. Don&#39;t forget to flip midway! :)"
- "When it&#39;s time to take the chicken out, using your tongs, gently shake off excess oil, and set it on your lined sheet pan or platter. And that&#39;s it! Looks like a lot, but it&#39;s pretty simple. The yogurt really does help to make moist, tender, flavorful fried chicken. :)"
- "Enjoy! :)"

Chicken gets brined in flavorful buttermilk before hitting the fryer for a crisp, golden crust. For me, as a kid growing up in New York, fried chicken came from one place, and one place only: those grease-stained cardboard buckets peddled by the Colonel himself. Remove chicken from brining liquid and pat dry. Combine flour, cornmeal, salt, and red pepper flakes in a shallow dish.

Remove chicken from brining liquid and pat dry. Combine flour, cornmeal, salt, and red pepper flakes in a shallow dish. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. The yogurt mixture really sticks to the chicken and makes it tasty and tender. I have a chicken tikka masala recipe which calls for marinading chicken thigh chunks in yogurt before grilling and adding to the tomato sauce. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
