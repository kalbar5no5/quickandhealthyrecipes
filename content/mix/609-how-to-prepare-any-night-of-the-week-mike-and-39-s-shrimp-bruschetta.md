recipeinstructions:
- "If using [dried] sun dried tomatoes - place them in 1/2 cup red wine and enough water to cover them. Boil until soft. About 3 minutes. Drain and chop. If not, fine chop and place in frying pan."
- "If serving a Chilled or Warmed Bruchetta - chop your tomatoes and fully drain your canned artichokes. Gently squeeze artichokes in cheese cloth or a clean towel to complete straining if needed. You can use artichokes in oil - just shake them off and drain as much as you can."
- "For a Warmed Bruschetta:                                Add 2 tbs olive oil to your pan, heat it up and add your onions, garlic, sun dried tomatoes and shrimp.                                                                            Fry until onions and garlic are just translucent and shrimp are pink. About three minutes. You&#39;ll want a slight crisp to your veggies so don&#39;t over cook them. Or, burn your garlic. ° Shrimp not pictured. It was a little late arriving!"
- "Add your tomato mixture and cook until heated. About 2 minutes.               One tip if you have the time: Sit your fresh basil and fresh parsley to the side - add them to your heated tomato mixture and toss 35 seconds before serving."
- "For a Chilled Bruschetta:                                Use pre-steamed shrimp instead of the raw called for in the warmed bruchetta. Drain your artichokes well.                                                                      Mix everything in a large bowl. Allow it all to marinate for at least an hour in the fridge. The sea salt will help pull some additional fluids from both your tomatoes and artichokes."
- "When ready to serve - mix again - pull contents from marinade bowl and place on toasted bread. Sprinkle tops with fresh shaved Parmesan Cheese and garnish with fresh basil, parsley, black pepper and sea salt."
- "Pile tomato mixture on top of toasted seasoned bread. Sprinkle with fresh shaved Parmesan Cheese and garnish with fresh basil, parsley, black pepper and sea salt."
- "Slice bread 1&#34; thick and grill [or toast] until scored and crispy. Add butter, garlic butter, olive oil or scrape grilled bread tops with raw garlic cloves while the bread is still warm."

Beautiful Bowls perfect for lunch and dinner. The dip was very dry and not much there for the price. Bruschetta was quite salty and not as good as the one at Coquitlam. The service at the door was very friendly but the table service was not up to what we usually experience at Mr. More Mike&#39;s Stuffed Chicken Baked chicken breast stuffed with sundried tomatoes, spinach and Mozzarella, with penne all in a light garlic cream sauce. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
