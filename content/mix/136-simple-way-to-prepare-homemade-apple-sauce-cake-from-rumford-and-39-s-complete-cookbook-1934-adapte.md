Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
