Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
