Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
