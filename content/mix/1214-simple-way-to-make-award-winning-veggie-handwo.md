Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
