We love having Mexican food for dinner and think it&#39;s best when it&#39;s homemade! It&#39;s ground from lean sirloin, so it won&#39;t exude as much fat and grease as it cooks.

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
