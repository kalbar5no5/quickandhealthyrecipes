- "2 cup Sliced or torn bread"
- "1 1/2 cup Milk"
- "1 Chicken egg"
- "1 cup Freshly grated parmesan cheese medium grate plus more for service presentation"
- "1 medium White onion finely diced"
- "2 clove Garlic minced"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Fennel seed"
- "1 tbsp Italian Seasoning"
- "1 tbsp Extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 pinch Red pepper flake"
- "1 Your favorite marinara sauce"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Kosher salt"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Freshlyground black pepper"
- "2 pinch Kosher salt"
- " Meatball Subs"
- "12 provolone or mozzarella or both slices"
- "6 Hoagie buns"
- " Meatballs for Pasta"
- "6 Servings cooked pasta"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a large saute pan on low to medium-low heat. Toast the fennel seeds and red pepper flake in the pan for one to two minutes, taking care to not burn the spices. Add the olive oil and raise heat on the pan to medium."
- "Add the diced onion to the sauté pan and one pinch of Kosher salt. Sweat onions for 5-6 minutes and add minced garlic. Sweat for another 5-6 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning, sweat another minute or two and remove from heat and allow to cool to around room temp."
- "Soak the bread pieces in the milk. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. After the bread pieces have soaked up as much milk as possible, drain the excess and mash the bread with a fork so there are no large or medium sized chunks. Stir the bread and grated parmesan to combine in the large mixing bowl with the beaten egg mixture."
- "Add cooled onion mixture to bread mixture and stir to combine. Add ground pork and ground beef to the mixture along with the 1/2 TBSP of Kosher salt and 1/2 TBSP of freshly-ground black pepper. It&#39;s easiest (for me, anyway) to mix this with your hands. Don&#39;t worry about over-mixing. Make sure the entire mixture is as homogeneous as possible."
- "For Meatballs and pasta: Turn on your oven&#39;s broiler and put a rack about 3/4 of the way to the top. Form the meat mixture into 3-4 ounce balls (you&#39;ll have about 12-15 meatballs) and place them in a 9x13 roasting pan. Place them under the broiler for about 20 minutes or until the internal temperature is 165°F. The inside of the meatball will remain juicy, tender and flavorful. Serve with pasta and marinara and garnish with parmesan cheese."
- "For &#34;Meatball&#34; Sandwiches: Form the meat mixture into patties. Fry in a pan on the stove top. Melt cheese over the patties. Toast a split hoagie roll. Assemble sandwich with a few tsps of marinara."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
