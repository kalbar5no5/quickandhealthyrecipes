Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
