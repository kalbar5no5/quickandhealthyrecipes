Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
