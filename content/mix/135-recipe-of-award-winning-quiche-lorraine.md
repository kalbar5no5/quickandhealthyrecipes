Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
