Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
