Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
