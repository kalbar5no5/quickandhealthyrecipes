Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
