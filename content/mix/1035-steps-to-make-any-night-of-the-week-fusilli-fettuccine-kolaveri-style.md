Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
