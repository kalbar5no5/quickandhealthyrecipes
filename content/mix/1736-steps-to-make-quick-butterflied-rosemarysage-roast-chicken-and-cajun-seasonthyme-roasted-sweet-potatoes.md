Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
