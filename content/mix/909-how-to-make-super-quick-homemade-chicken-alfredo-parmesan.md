Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
