Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
