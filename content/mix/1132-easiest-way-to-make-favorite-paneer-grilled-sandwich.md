Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood.

These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them.
