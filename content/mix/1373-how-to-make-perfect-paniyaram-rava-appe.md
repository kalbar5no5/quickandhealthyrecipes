Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
