Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
