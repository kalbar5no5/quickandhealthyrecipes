Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
