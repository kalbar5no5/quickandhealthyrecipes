Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
