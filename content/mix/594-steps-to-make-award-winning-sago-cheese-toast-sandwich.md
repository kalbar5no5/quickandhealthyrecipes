Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
