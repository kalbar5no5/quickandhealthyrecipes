Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
