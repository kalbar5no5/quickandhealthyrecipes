Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!
