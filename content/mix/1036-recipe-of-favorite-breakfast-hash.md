Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
