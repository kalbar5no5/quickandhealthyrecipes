How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
