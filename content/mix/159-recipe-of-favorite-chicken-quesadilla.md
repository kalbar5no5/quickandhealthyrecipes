Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
