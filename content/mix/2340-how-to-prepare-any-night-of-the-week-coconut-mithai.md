Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
