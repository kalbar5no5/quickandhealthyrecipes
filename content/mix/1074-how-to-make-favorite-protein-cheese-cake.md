Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
