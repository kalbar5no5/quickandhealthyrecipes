Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
