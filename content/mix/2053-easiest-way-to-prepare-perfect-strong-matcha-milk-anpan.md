Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
