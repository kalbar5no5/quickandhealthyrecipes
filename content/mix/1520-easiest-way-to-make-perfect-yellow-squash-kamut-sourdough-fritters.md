Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
