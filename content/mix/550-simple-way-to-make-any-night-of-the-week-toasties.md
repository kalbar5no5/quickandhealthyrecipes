Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
