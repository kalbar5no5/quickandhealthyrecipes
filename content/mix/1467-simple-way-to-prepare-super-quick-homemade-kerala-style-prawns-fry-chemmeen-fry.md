Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
