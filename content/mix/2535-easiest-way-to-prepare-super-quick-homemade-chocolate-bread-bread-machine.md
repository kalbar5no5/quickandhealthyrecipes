Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
