Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
