Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
