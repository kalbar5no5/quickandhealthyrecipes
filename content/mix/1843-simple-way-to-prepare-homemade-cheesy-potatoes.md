Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
