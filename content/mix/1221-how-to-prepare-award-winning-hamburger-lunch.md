Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
