Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
