How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
