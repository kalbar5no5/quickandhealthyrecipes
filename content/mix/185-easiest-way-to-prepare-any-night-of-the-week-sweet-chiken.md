How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
