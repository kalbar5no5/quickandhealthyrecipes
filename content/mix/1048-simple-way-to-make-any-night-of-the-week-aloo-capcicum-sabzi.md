Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
