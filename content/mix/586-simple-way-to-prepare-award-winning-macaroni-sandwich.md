Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
