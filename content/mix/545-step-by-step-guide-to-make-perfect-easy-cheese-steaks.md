Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
