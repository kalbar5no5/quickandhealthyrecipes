Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
