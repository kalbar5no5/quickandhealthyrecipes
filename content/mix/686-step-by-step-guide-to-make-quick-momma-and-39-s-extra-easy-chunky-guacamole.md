Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
