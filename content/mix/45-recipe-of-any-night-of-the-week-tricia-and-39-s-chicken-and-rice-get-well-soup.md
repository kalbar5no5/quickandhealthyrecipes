How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
