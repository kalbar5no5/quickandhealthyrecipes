Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
