Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels.

Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!
