Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
