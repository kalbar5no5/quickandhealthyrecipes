Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
