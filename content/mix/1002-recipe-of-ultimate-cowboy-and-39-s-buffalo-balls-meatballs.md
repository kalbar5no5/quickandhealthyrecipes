Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
