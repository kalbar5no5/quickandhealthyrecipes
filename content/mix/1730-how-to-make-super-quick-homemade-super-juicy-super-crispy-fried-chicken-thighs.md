I use my cast iron skillet on my outdoor grill side burner. Wipe each piece thoroughly with paper towels before frying. These oven-baked thighs get their crunch from panko: thighs are dipped in tangy buttermilk &amp; toasted panko then oven-baked to juicy, crispy perfection. A buttermilk brine ensures a juicy, tender piece of fried chicken It&#39;s super crispy, crunchy, juicy, with a nice spiciness. You can easily make it SUPER spicy by doubling the heat if you dare. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
