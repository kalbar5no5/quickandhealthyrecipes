Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
