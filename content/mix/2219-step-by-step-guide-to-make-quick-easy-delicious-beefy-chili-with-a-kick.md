Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
