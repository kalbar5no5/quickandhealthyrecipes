Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
