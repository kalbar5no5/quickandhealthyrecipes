Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
