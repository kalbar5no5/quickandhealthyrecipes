Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
