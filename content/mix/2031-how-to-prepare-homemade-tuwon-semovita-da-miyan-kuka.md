Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
