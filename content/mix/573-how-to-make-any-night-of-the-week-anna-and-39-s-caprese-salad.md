It is the perfect quick and easy accompaniment to any summer meal. My husband and I love Caprese salad, but not the high prices we pay for it in restaurants. Here, we created our own version which tastes incredibly close, if not better, than any restaurant version we&#39;ve tried. â€”Melissa Pearson, Sandy, Utah I love Caprese salads but sometimes they can be a little bland. The classic recipe calls for just a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkling of salt and pepper to flavor the salad, so as not to mask the delicate flavor of the mozzarella, but I like to add just a bit more oomph. Here&#39;s how: I start by sprinkling the tomatoes with a pinch of sugar, which brings out their natural sweetness. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
