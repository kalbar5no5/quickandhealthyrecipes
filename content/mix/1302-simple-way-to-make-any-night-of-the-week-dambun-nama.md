Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
