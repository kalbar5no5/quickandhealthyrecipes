Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
