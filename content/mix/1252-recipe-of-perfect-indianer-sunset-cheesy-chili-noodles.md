How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
