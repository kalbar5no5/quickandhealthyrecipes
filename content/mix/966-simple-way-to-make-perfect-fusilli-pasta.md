Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
