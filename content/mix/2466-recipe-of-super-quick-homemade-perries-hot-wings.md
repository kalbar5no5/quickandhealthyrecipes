Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
