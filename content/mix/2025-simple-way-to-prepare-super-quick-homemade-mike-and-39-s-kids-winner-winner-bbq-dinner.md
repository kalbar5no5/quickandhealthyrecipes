- "Coat an oven safe dish with a slight amount of olive oil and fully coat chicken breasts with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce. Top and bottom.   Reserve some BBQ sauce for your Baked Beans and basting while grilling your chicken.  You can use your remaining sauce in your oven safe chicken bowl once baked but, fresh/uncooked sauce is more viscous and will help to char your chicken better."

- "My student also made homemade Ranch Dressing. 1 cup whole milk, 1 cup quality mayonnaise, a 1 oz Ranch Dressing packet, a Mason jar and 1 minute of shaking it is all it took her.   Homemade Ranch Dressing is SO much better than bottled. You wouldn&#39;t believe the difference!"
- "Pull chicken and beans from oven. Stir beans."
- "Place chicken on a hot, clean grill until fully charred.   Baste chicken with BBQ Sauce while grilling.  Know that brined meats are much harder to char on a grill. So, make sure your grill is searing hot. Trust me - you&#39;ll want some serious char on your chicken!"
- "Enjoy your taste of a very simple, Southern BBQ supper!"

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
