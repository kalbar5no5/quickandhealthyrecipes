Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
