It&#39;s incredibly flavorful, it&#39;s packed with protein and perfectly hearty, plus it&#39;s a dinner everyone can agree on. While I do make a classic chili recipe on the stove top, slow cooker meals are amazing for busy days! There is nothing like coming home to a ready meal on a cold evening but crock pot dishes are great in the warmer months too with no need to turn on the oven or stove and heat up the house! Mild enough for the whole family, but still packed with tons of flavor!

There is nothing like coming home to a ready meal on a cold evening but crock pot dishes are great in the warmer months too with no need to turn on the oven or stove and heat up the house! Mild enough for the whole family, but still packed with tons of flavor! As the seasons start to change, the first thing I start to crave (after pumpkin in all the things) is chili. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add ground turkey and cook, stirring occasionally, until turkey is. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
