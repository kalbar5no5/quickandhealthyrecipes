Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
