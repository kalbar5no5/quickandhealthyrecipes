This hibachi chicken and fried rice recipe is rich, perfectly seasoned, and tastes like it was just made at your favorite Japanese restaurant. This the perfect way to make hibachi at home! The mustard sauce is sweet and just a little spicy, and adds a flavorful kick to the chicken, veggies, and fried rice.

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
