Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
