At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body.
