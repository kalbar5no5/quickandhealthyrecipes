Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
