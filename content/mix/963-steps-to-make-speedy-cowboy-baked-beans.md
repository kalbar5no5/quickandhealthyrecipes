How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
