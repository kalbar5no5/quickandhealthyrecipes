Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
