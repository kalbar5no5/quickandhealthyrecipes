Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood.

Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest.
