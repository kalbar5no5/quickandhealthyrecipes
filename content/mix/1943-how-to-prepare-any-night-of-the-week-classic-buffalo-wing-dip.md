Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
