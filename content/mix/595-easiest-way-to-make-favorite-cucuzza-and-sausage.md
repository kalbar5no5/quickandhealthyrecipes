Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
