Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
