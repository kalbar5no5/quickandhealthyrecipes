recipeingredient:
- "148 g whole milk"
- "200 g strong flour white or wholemeal"
- "24 g sugar"
- "2.5 g dry yeast"
- "2.5 g salt"
- "16 g unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the milk in a microwave about 20-30 seconds to make it warm. Or just heat it up in a pan. Please never make it too hot as yeast will die at 60 degrees. Around the temperature of bath would be perfect. If it is too hot, leave it till it becomes warm."
- "Add flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a bowl or on board and mix them. Then, add the warm milk. Then, knead by hands for about 10 mins on a board or knead for about 10 mins with a stand mixer using a kneading hook or a bread machine. The time will depend on your machine."
- "Knead well here until the dough becomes stretchy and gluten is formed. When gluten is formed, you touch the dough and it doesn&#39;t stick to bowl and become one. Also if you stretch it becomes very thin sheet almost see-through it. It should look smook."
- "Add chopped or very soft butter and knead further for about 3-5 mins until the dough becomes smooth and not stick to the bowl like the last photo. I should look silky, bouncy and smooth."
- "Take the dough out and make it round with the motion on tucking inside at the bottom. It should become smooth like the photos below. It is not smooth, knead it with hand. I usually hit it like a ball and it will become silky and very smooth."
- "Cover it with cling film and leave it for 30-40 mins until it becomes about twice. It can take much longer. I put hot water with 36-45℃ beneath like in the photo."
- "Test the fermentation with a finger coated by flour. If it is the hole remains, the first fermentation has been done."
- "Preheat the oven at 180℃."
- "After having tested the fermentation, take out the dough and punch it down. Make it round again. Take two about 30 g balls which become ears and the rest. And put them bread tin. You can get this cute bear tin at Amazon UK: https://amzn.to/2W3qULk"
- "Leave it in a warm place until it expand 80% of the tin. If you would like to eat in the morning, put it in the fridge."
- "Put the bread tin with lid in the oven and turn down the temperature as 160℃. Then, bake at 160℃ for about 20 mins. Please make sure you reduce the temperature to 160℃. If you bake it at 180℃, your bread becomes harder. If your oven is powerful enough and it does not go down the temperature when you open, just preheat it as 160℃."
- "After having baked about 20 mins, take out the bread from the tin. Leave it cool."
- "Done. Children love to draw faces with choco pens."
- "I use this choco pen."
- "I got a cat bread tin now. So, I can make cat shaped bread as well."

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
