Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
