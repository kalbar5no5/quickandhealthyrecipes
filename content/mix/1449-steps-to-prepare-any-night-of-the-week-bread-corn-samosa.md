When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood.

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood.

They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process.
