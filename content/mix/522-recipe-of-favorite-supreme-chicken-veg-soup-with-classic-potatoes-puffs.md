Suprême sauce (or sauce suprême) is a classic sauce in French cuisine. Suprême sauce derives from velouté sauce, a &#34;mother sauce&#34; traditionally made from roux (a mixture of butter and flour) and meat stock—in this case, chicken stock or chicken broth. The sauce is reduced with heavy cream or crème fraîche, strained through a fine sieve or strainer, and often finished with lemon juice. Heat a small amount of vegetable oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat. Pan-fry the chicken breast skin-side down until golden. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
