How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
