Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
