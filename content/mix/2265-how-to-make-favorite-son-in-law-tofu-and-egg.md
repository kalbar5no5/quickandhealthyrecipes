How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
