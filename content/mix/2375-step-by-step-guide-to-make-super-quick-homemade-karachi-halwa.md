Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
