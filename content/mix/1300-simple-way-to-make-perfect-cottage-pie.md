Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
