Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
