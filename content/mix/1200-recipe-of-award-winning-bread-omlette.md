Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
