Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!
