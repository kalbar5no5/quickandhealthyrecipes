Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
