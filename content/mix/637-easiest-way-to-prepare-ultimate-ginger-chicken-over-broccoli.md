Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
