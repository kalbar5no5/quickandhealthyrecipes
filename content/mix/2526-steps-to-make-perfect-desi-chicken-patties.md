Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!
