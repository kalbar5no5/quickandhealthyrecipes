Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
