Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
