Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
