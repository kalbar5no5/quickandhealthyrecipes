Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
