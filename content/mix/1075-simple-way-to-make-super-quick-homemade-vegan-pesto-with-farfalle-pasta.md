Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
