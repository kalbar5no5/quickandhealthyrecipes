Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood.

Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body.
