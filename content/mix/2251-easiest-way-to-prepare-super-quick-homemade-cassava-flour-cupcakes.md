How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
