Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
