Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
