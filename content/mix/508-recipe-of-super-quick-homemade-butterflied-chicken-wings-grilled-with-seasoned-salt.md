Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
