Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
