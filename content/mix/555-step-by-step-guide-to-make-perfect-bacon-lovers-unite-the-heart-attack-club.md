Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
