Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
