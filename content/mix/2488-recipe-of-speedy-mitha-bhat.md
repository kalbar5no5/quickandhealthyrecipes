How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
