Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
