Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
