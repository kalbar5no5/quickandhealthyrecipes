Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
