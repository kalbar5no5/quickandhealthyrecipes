Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
