Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
