Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
