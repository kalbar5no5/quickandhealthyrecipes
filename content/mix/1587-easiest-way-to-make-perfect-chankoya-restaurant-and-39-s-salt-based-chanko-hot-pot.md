From the Complete Book of Japanese Cooking. A protein rich Japanese style hot pot dish, chanko nabe is famous for being eaten regularly by sumo wrestlers, as it provides them with the energy they need in the ring. Like other nabe hot pot dishes, this recipe is designed to be cooked in a communal hotpot on the centre of the dining table.

It usually features one kind of meat or fish, tofu, vegetables, and big chunks of calorie-dense mochi, a starchy. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
