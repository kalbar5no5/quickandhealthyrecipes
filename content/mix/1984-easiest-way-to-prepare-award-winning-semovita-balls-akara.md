How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
