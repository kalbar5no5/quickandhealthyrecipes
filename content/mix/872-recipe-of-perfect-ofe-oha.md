Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
