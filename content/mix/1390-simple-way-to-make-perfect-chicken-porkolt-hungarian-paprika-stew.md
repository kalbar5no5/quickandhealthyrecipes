How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
