Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
