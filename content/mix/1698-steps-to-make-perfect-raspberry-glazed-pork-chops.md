How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
