Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
