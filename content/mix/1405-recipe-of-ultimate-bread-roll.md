Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
