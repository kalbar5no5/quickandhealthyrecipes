Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
