Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
