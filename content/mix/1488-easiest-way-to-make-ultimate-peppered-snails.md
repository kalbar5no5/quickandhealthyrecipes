Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
