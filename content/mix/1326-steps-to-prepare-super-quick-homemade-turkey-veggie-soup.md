Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
