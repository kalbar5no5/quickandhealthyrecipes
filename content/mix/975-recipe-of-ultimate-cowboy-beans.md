Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
