Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed.
