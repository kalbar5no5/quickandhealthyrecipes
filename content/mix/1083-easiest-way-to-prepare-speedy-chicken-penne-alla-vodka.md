Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
