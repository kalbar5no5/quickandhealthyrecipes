Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
