Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
