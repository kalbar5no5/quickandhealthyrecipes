Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
