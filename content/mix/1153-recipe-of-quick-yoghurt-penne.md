Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
