Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
