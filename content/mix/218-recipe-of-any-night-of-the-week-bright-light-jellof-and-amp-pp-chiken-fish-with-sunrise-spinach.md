Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
