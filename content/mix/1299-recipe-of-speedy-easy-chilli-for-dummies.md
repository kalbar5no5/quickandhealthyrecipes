Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
