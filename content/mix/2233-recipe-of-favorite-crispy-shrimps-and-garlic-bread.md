Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
