Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
