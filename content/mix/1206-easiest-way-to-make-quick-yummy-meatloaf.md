##### The ingredients needed to make Yummy Meatloaf:

1. Get 2 lbs ground chuck
1. Get 2 Tbsp kosher salt
1. Take 1 Tbsp Course black pepper
1. Make ready 1/2 sm. can tomato sauce
1. Get 1/2 green bell pepper (chopped)
1. Make ready 2 small garlic cloves

Meatloaf has more flavour because whereas you wouldn&#39;t eat a hamburger without toppings, sauces, cheese and a bun, you can certainly eat Meatloaf plain because it&#39;s so juicy and tasty! The secret to making a meatloaf taste really good is to use fatty beef, plenty of flavourings and to grate your onion instead of dicing it. Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan. I made half a recipe specifically for meatloaf sandwiches, good old-fashioned comfort food.

Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan. I made half a recipe specifically for meatloaf sandwiches, good old-fashioned comfort food. My husband and I (who are NOT big meatloaf fans) loved the heck out of this recipe. It was painfully simple and simply delicious. It&#39;s not too ketchupy, which I really like. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
