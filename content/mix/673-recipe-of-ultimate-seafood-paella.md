Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
