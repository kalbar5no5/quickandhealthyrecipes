Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
