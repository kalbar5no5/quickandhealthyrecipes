Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
