How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
