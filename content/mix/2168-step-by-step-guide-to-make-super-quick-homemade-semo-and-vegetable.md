How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
