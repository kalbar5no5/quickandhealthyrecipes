Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
