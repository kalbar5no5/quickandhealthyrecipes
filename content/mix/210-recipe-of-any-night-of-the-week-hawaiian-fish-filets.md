Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
