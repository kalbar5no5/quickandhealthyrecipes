How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
