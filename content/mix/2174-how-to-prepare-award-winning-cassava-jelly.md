Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
