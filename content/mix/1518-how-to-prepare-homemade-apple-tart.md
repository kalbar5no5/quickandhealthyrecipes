Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
