Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
