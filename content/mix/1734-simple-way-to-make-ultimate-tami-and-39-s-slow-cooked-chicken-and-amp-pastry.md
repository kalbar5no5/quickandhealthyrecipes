Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
