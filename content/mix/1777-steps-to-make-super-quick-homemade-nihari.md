Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
