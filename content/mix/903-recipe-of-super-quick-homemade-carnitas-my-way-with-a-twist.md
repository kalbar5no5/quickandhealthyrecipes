Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
