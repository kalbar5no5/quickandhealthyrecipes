Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
