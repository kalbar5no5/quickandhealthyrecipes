Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
