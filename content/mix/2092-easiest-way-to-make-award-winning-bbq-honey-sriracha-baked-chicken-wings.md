Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
