How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
