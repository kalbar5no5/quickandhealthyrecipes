Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
