recipeingredient:
- "300 grams chicken breast sliced"
- "4-5 cloves garlic minced"
- "1-1.5 chilli red chopped"
- "1 teaspoon oyster sauce"
- "1/2 teaspoon light soya sauce"
- "1/2 teaspoon brown sugar"
- "1 splash dark soya sauce"
- "1 handful basil leaves chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat your wok on high heat, and add about 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. When the oil is hot, add the chilies and garlic. Stir fry them for about 20 seconds or so until they get really fragrant, but don&#39;t let them burn or get too dry."
- "Toss in your chicken. Keep stir frying continuously. At this stage you want to continue to stir and cook your chicken until it&#39;s just about fully cooked all the way through (depending on the size pieces of chicken and how hot your fire is, it should take about 2 - 3 minutes). If it starts to get dry, add just a tiny splash of water."
- "Add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon sugar, and finally a splash of dark soy sauce. Keep stir frying for about another 30 seconds."
- "Grab a handful of holy basil, toss it into the pan, fold it into the chicken, and then immediately turn off the heat (if you&#39;re using an electric stove, you&#39;ll want to remove the pan from the burner). The holy basil really only needs to cook for about 5 seconds, and it will continue to wilt and cook from the existing heat of the chicken. This step is important because if you cook the basil for too long, it loses some of its glorious flavor and gets slightly chewy."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
