Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
