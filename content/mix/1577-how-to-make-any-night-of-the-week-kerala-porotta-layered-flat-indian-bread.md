Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
