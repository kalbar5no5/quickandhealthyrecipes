How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
