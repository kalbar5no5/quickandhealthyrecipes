Slice the sandwich in quarters diagonally. Skewers or long toothpicks may be used to hold all the layers together. This is a basic club sandwich you&#39;ll find on the menus of most restaurants in Canada with the exception it doesn&#39;t include cheese whether it be processed or swiss. I always add salt and pepper in moderation to the tomatoes. I also find Miracle Whip rather than mayonnaise adds a little more pizzazz. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
