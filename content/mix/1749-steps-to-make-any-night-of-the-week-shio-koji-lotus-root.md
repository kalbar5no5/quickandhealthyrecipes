Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
