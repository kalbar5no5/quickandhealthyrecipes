Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
