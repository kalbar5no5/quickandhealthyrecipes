Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
