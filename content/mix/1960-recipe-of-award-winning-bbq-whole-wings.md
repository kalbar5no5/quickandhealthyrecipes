Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!
