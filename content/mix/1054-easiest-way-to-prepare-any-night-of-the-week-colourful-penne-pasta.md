Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
