Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
