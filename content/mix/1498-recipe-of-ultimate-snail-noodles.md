How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
