Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
