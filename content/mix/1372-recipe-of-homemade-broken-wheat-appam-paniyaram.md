Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
