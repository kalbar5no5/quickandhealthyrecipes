Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
