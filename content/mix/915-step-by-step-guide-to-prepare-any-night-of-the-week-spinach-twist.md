Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
