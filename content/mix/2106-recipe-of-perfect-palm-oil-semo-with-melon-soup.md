How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
