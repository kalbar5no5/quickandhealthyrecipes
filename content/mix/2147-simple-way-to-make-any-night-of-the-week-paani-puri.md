Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
