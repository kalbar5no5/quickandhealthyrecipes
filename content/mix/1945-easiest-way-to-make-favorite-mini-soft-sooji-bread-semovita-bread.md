This is a bread of beauty; golden brown, crispy crust topped with crunchy seeds (and perhaps spices) and a soft, yielding interior. It is another gem of a recipe from the King Arthur Flour Company and their top notch baker&#39;s test kitchen. I bought the flour because I&#39;m interested in recreating the Semolina Bread of my childhood. I grew up in an Italian section of Brooklyn where the local bakery produced very crusty free-form loaves (shaped like rye bread) that were totally covered in sesame seeds. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
