Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
