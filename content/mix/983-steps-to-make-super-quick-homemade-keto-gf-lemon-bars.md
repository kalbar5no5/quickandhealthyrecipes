Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
