Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
