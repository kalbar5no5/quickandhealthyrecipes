Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
