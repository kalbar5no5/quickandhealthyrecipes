Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
