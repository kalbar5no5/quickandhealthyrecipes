Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
