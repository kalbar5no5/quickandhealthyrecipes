Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
