Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
