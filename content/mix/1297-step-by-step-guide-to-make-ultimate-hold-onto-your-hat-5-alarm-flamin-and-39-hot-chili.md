Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
