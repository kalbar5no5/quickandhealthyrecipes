Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
