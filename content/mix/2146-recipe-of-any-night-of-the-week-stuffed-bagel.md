Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
