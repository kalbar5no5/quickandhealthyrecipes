Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
