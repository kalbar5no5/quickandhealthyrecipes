How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
