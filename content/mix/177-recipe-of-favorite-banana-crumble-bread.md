How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
