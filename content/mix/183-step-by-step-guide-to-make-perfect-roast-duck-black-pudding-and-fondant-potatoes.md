Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
