Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
