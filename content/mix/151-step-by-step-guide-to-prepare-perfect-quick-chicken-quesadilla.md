How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
