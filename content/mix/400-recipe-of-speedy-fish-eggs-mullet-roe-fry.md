Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
