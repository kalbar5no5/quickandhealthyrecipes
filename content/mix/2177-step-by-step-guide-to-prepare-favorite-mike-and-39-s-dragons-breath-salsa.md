Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
