Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine.
