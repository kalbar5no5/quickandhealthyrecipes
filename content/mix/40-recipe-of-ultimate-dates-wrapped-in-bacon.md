Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
