Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
