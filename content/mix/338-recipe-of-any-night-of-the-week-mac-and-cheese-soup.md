Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
