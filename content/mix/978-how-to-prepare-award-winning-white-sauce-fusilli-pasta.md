Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
