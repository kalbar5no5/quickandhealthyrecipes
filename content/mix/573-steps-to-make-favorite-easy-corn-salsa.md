Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
