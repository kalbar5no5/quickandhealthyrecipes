Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood.

The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!
