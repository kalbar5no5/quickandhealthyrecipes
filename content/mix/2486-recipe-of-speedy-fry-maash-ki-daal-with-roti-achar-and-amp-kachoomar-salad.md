Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
