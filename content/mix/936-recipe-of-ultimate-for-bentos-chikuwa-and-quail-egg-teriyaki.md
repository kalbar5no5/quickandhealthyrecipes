- "1 tsp Katakuriko"
- "1 tbsp of each Sugar soy sauce mirin"
- "8 eggs Quail eggs boiled or canned"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the chikuwa in half! Wrap around the eggs and secure with toothpicks. It looks better if you wrap the chikuwa with the browned side facing out, and the flavors will blend better."
- "Lightly brown the back in a pan. Use a little oil if you like (It will look delicious if you burn it slightly!)"
- "Prepare the sauce while they are cooking. Make sure to mix in the katakuriko as well. Make sure the katakuriko doesn&#39;t sink to the bottom (by continuously stirring), and pour in the sauce. Keep stirring."
- "Reduce to low heat, and add the sauce to the pan. The sauce will immediately thicken, so please shake the pan back and forth. This part is important!"
- "Cook over low heat until the rolls are evenly coated with the sauce. Garnishing with a bit of parsley or sesame looks very pretty."
- "Wipe the ends of the toothpicks a bit with a wet tissue. Regular tissues will stick, so make sure to use a wet tissue."
- "f you don&#39;t have quail eggs, they taste great just using only chikuwa as well. They are still quite hearty ."

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
