Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
