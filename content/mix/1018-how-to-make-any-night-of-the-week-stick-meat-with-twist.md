Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
