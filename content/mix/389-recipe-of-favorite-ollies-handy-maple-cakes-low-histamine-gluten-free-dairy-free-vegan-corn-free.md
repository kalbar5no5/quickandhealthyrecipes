Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
