Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
