Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
