Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
