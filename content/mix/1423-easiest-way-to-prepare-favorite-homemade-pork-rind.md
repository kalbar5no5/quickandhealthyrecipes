Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
