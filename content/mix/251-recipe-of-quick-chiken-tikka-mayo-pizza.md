Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
