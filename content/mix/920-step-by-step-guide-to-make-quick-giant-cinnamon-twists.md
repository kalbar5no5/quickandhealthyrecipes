Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
