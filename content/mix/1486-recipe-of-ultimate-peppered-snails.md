Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
