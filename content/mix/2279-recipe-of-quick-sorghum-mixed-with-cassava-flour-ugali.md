How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
