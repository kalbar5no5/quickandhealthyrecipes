How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
