Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
