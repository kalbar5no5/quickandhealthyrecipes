##### Instructions to make Fish Sausage Noppe&#39;i Soup with Plenty of Root Veggies:

1. Peel the vegetables, and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces. Soak the dried shiitake mushrooms in 100 ml of lukewarm water to reconstitute, then chop these into bite-sized pieces as well.
1. Put the water and shiitake soaking liquid in a sauce pan, add the ● ingredients and vegetables, then heat (as I prefer lotus root on the firm side, I add it later).
1. When the vegetables become tender, add the sausage cut into bite-sized pieces.
1. Thicken the soup with the katakuriko slurry, then it&#39;s done. Add green vegetables to garnish. I sprinkled parboiled edamame.


Add the sausages, then add the tomatoes, stock, herbs, salt and pepper. Add the beans to the soup and bring back to a simmer. Take the sausage meat out of the casings and crumble it into a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Drain a bit of the fat, leaving some in for flavor. I prep as I go along, so I chop the onion and get the other ingredients started as the sausage cooks. 

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
