Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
