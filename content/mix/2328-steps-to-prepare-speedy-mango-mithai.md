Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
