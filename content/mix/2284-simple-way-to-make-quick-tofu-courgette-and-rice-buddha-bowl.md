Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
