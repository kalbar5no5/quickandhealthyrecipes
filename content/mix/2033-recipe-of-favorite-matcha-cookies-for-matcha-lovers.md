- "140 grams White flour"
- "15 grams  Matcha"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "100 grams Cake margarine or unsalted butter"

recipeinstructions:
- "Bring cake margarine to room temperature. Measure all ingredients. Combine ● ingredients (flour, matcha, salt) and sift."
- "Put the margarine, now at room temperature, into a bowl and knead until it&#39;s slightly soft."

- "Now using a spatula, add all sifted ingredients into the bowl. Mix roughly."
- "If you mash the margarine as you mix, you&#39;ll get a nice result. When the dough looks like this, make one huge chunk and divide into 2 or 3 portions (roughly)."
- "Put the dough onto a plastic wrap and shape into square sticks about 3cm in width. Place on a flat container if possible, and freeze for about 30 minutes to 1 hour to harden."
- "Slice into 1cm thickness. When it&#39;s hard and frozen, it will break apart when you cut. Set aside in room temperature for a while for a better result."
- "Align on a baking pan aligned with parchment paper and bake for about 15 minutes in a 180℃ preheated oven. Make sure to leave enough space because it will raise."
- "Let it cool on the baking pan. Caution: Make sure not to burn it because that will destroy the aroma of matcha."
- "Update: You can also sprinkle granulated sugar (unlisted) on the dough before you bake. It becomes nice and crunchy when it&#39;s baked."
- "You can also add tea leaves like Western tea cookies. If you want texture, chop up the leaves. Also try with black tea and houjicha roasted tea."
- "Here&#39;s how it looks like when you sprinkle granulated sugar. Also with green tea leaves. The tea leaves are actually inconspicuous, but add to the aroma."
- "Even my 2-year-old son enjoys it. He loves matcha, just like me!"

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
