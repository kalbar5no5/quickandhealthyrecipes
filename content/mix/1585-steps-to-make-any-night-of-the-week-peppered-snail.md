Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
