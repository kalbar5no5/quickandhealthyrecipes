Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
