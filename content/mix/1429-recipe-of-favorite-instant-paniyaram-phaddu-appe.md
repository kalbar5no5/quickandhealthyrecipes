How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
