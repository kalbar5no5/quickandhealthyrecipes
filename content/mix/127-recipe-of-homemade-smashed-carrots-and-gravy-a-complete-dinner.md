Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Rub skin of chicken with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Boston Market found a happy middle that proved to be just enough gravy to eat with the mashed potatoes without turning the meal into turkey stew. If your family prefers just peas, or just peas and carrots, for example, use those instead! If your kids love cheese, try sprinkling some grated cheese over top of the potatoes before the dish goes in the oven. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
