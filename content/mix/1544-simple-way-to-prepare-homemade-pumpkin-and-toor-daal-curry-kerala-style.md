Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
