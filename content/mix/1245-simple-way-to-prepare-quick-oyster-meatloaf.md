Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
