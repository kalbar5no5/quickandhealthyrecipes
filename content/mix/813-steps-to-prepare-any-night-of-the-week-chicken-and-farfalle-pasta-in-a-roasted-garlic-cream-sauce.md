recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 400째F.  Peel away the outer layers of the heads of garlic, leaving the skins of the individual cloves intact.  Cut off 1/2&#34; of the top of the cloves.  Place the heads of garlic in a muffin pan, drizzle olive oil over the cut tops of the garlic.  Use your fingers to make sure the heads are well coated.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30-35 minutes.  Allow the garlic to cool enough so you can touch it.  Use a small knife to loosen the skin around each clove and then squeeze from the bottom end and release the garlic from their cloves.  Use a knife to mash or mince the garlic.  Set aside."
- "Lower the oven temperature to 375째F.  Trim fat from the chicken breasts and pat dry.  Season both sides of chicken with salt, pepper, herbs de provence and garlic powder.  Place in a baking dish and roast chicken for 30 minutes or until just cooked throuh.  Set aside to cool for a few minutes.  Cut the chicken in to bite size pieces and set aside."
- "While the chicken is cooking, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large saute pan.  Add the chopped pancetta and cook until crispy.  Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel lined plate to drain excess grease.  Set aside."
- "In the same pan, add the sliced mushrooms and saute on medium heat until most of the liquid has evaporated.  Then add the chopped onions and saute over medium heat until they are carmelized, as are the mushrooms."
- "Add the sun-dried tomatoes to the pan and cook for another 3 minutes.  Deglaze the pan by adding the wine, using a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan to release the brown bits (extra flavor).  Bring wine to a simmer and cook until it has reduced by half."
- "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add salt to the water, then add the farfalle pasta.  Cook until al dente, using the package directions.  Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid."
- "Add the heavy cream to the pan, bring to a simmer.  Now add the roasted garlic and whisk well to incorporate.  Add the cubed chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes until slightly thickened."
- "Add 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and stir constantly to incorporate well.  Use pasta water to thin the sauce if it gets too thick.  Add salt and pepper to taste, then add the drained pasta to the sauce, along with the frozen peas and chopped parsley.  Stir to warm the peas and add 1/2 the pancetta and toss pasta again."
- "Transfer pasta to a serving dish and garnish with the remaining pancetta and a little parmesan cheese.  Enjoy!!"
- "I know roasting your own garlic seems like a lot of work, but once you taste it, you&#39;ll understand why it&#39;s so worth it!!"

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
