Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
