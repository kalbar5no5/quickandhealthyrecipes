Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
