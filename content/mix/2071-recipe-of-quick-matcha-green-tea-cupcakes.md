Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
