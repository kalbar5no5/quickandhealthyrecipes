How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!
