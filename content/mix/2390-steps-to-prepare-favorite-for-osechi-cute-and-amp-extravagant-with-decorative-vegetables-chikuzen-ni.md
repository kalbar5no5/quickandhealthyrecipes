Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
