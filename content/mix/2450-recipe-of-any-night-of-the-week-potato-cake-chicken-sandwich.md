Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
