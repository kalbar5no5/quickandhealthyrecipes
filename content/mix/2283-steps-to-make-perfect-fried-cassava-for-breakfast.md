These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
