This is my husband&#39;s easy chili recipe. Cool thing about this chili was the change in flavor from the first day to the second - it was like a whole new meal, the taco really came through on the second day. I can see how the pasta sauce would make a huge difference in this recipe, mine was very thick and the chili ended up really thick as well. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
