Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
