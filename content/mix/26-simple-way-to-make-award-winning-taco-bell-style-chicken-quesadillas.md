Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
