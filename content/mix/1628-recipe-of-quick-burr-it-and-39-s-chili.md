Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body.
