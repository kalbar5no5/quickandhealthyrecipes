That&#39;s how the strawberry mocktail mule was born, and it&#39;s oh-so-good. The lime and the ginger give it a nice bite/kick and the strawberry puree sweetens it up just enough, without overpowering the ginger. I made a strawberry puree from a bag of frozen strawberries, and I put into a squeeze bottle. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
