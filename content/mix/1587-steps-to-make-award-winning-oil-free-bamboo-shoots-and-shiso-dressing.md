Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
