Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
