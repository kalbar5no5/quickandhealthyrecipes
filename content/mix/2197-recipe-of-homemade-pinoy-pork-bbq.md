Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest.
