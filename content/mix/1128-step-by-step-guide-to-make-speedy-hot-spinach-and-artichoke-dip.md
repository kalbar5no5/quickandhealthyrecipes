Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
