Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
