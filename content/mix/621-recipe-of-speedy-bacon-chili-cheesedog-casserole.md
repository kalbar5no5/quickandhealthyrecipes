Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
