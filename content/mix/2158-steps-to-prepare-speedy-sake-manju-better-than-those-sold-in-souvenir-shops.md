- "100 grams Sake lees"
- "3 tbsp Sake"
- "120 grams Cake flour"
- "2 tsp Baking powder"
- "100 grams Sugar I use raw cane sugar"
- "500 grams Anko I used koshian"
recipeinstructions:
- "[To prepare the ingredients] Microwave the sake lees for 20 seconds, then strain. Sift together the cake flour and baking powder. Make 25 g balls of anko."
- "Strain the sake lees, and mix in the sake until smooth. Add the sugar, then mix until well blended. Add the rest of the dry ingredients, then mix until it&#39;s no longer floury."
- "Dust a metal tray with flour (not listed), then place the dough on top, lightly roll into a ball, then separate it into 20 pieces. Next, wrap the dough around the balls of anko."
- "The anko balls should look like this. When wrapping, lightly spread the dough on the palm of your hand, place the anko on top, then stretch the dough around while pulling it over any gaps. The dough is quite sticky, but it will become hard if you use too much flour for dusting."
- "Place the prepared manju on parchment paper cut into 5 x 5 cm square sheets."
- "Fill a pot (steamer) with water, add about 1 teaspoon sake (not listed), then bring to a boil. Spritz the manju with water, then steam over high heat. It should take 13-15 minutes. The manju should be spaced about 5 cm apart or else they will stick, as they did in this photo."
- "The manju on the left has not yet been steamed, while the one on the right has been steamed through. They should rise about this much. The surface will shine if left to cool at room temperature. By the way, they taste great fresh from the steamer!"
- "Since steaming is troublesome, I tried microwaving them. I microwaved them with a cup filled with water for 2 minutes. They came out dry, hard, and did not rise. The moisture also was drawn out of the anko paste--in short, it was a complete failure!"

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
