Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
