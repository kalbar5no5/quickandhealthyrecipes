Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
