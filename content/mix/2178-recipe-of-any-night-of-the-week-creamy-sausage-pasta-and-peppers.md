Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
