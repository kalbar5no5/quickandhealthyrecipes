Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
