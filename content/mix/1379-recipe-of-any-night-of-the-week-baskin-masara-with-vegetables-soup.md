Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
