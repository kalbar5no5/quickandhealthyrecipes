Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
