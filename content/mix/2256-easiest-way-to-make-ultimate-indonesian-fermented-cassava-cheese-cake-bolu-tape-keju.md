Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
