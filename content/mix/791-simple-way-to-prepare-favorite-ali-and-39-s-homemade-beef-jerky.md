Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
