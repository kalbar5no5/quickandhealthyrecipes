Hello everybody, it's me, Dave, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, fasting rice. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

A brown rice fast is a gentler method of fasting and can be very soothing A brown rice fast can be more stabilizing than other types of fasts. Brown rice is a complex carbohydrate, metabolizing and delivering energy-giving sugars slowly, over time. Rice fasting is rather soothing and gently removes toxins from your bloodstream allowing you to avoid a feeling of discomfort that is often present during fasting. In this case you abstain from all foods and drinks except water and brown rice.

Fasting Rice is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions every day. Fasting Rice is something that I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have fasting rice using 5 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook that.

It can be eaten for breakfast and/or as main meals along with a side of curd. Traditionally, in Maharashtra, it is served with Danyachi Amti, which is made with Peanuts. Otherwise it would not be fasting. Rice is high in carbohydrates and as such it will stimulate insulin. The good thing is that fasting does reduce insulin, which is what makes us fat and dependent on carbs in our diet for energy. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
