Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
