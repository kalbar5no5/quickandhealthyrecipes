Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
