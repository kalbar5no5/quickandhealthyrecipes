Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
