Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
