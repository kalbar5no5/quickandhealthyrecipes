Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
