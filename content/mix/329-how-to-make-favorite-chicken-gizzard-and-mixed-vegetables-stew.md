Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
