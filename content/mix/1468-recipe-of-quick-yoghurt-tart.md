Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
