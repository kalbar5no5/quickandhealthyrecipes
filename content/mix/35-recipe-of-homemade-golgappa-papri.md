The meetha pani is the usual sweet tamarind chutney. In this post I have shared jaljeera made from mint leaves and spices.

I still remember having Papdi chaat for the first time in a Punjabi restaurant in Mumbai (can&#39;t remember the restaurant&#39;s name). It was one of the best papdi chaat I had in Mumbai. When living in Delhi, I had papri chaat often, but cannot forget the one I had in Mumbai. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
