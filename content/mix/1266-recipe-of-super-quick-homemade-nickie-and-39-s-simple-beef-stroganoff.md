We recommend serving it with potatoes or over split buttered biscuits. There are, however, many variations to this, and depending on the recipe, the sauce could be made with a good homemade beef stock (broth) or, homemade or canned cream of mushroom soup or, French onion soup mix or, brown gravy mix. Season the meat with salt and pepper. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
