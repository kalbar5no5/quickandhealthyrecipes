Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
