recipeingredient:
- "3 Cups All Purpose Flour"
- "2 Tbsp Butter"
- "2 1/4 tsp dry Yeast"
- "3 Tbsp Sugar and more for coating"
- "1 Cup Milk"
- "1 Egg"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- " Cinnamon Powder for coating"
- " Oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and add milk, sugar, and salt. Mix well until everything is well dissolved. Crack the egg into the saucepan and mix well. Add the yeast and stir. Let it sit for 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl."
- "Add the flour and mix well with a wooden spoon. When everything is well mixed, use your hand to knead the dough for a few minutes, and shape it into a big ball. Cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size, usually about 1 hour to 1½ hours."
- "Deflate the gas with your hand and knead the dough for a few minutes until it’s soft and smooth. Cover with plastic wrap again and let it sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour until it doubles in size again."
- "Uncover the dough and knead it for a few minutes. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces."
- "Take a piece of dough and roll it out on your working surface so it forms a rope 10 inches long and ½ inch in diameter. If it’s sticky, sprinkle some flour on the working surface. When you roll out the dough, move one hand upward and the other downward so that the rope is twisted in between your hands as you roll it. Take the dough off the surface, hold it aloft, and bring the ends together. Place the twisted dough on a tray and repeat with the rest of the pieces."
- "Let the donuts expand for about 30 minutes. 15 minutes in, gently flip each donut over with your hands so the bottoms don’t get flat and all sides expand evenly."
- "Heat oil in a deep skillet and deep fry the donuts on medium heat. Cook for about 5 minutes, occasionally gently flipping them over, until they get crunchy outside and are well cooked on the inside."
- "Add some sugar and the cinnamon powder to a brown paper bag. Put in the donuts and shake a few times until they are evenly coated. This is best done when the donuts are still warm. Repeat this with all the donuts. Enjoy this labor of love."

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
