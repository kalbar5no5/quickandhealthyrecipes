Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
