Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
