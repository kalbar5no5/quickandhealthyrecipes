Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
