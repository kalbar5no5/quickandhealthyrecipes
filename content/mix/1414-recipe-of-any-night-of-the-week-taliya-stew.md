Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
