Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
