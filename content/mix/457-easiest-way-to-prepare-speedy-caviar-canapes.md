Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
