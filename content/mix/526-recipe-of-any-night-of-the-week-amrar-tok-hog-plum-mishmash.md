Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
