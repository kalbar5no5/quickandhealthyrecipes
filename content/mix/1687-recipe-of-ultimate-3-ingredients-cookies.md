The magic ingredient in these cookies is banana. Shortbread often has just three ingredients. We swapped the regular all-purpose flour for our favorite granola. Pulverized in the food processor, it acts just like flour to bind butter and a bit of powdered sugar.

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
