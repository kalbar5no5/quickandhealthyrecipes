Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
