Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
