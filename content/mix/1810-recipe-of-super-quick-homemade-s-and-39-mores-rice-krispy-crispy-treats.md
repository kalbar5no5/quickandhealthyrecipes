Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
