Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
