Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
