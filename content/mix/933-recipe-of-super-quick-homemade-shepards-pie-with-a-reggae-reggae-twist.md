Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
