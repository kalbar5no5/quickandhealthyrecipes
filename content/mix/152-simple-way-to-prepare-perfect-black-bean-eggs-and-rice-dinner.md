Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
