Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
