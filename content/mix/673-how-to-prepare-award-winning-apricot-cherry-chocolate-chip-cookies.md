Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
