Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
