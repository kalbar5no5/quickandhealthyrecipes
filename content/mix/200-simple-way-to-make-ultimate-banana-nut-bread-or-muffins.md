Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
