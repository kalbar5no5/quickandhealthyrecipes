Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
