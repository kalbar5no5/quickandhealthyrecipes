Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
