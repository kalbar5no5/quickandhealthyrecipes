Tofu stuffed with meat is a delicious, eye-catching Vietnamese dish, combined with the soft and mild taste of tofu with the filling of the rich minced meat laced with iridescent yellow sauce.

Cook, stirring occasionally, a few minutes or until slightly browned.


To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have meat filling tofu using 13 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
