Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
