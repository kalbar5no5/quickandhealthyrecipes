Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
