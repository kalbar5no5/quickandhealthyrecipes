Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
