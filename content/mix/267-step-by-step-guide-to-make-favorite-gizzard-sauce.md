Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
