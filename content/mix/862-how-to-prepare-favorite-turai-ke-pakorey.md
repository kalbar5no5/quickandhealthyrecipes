Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
