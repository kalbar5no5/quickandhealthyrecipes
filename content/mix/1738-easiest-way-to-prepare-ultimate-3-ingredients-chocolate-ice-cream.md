Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
