Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
