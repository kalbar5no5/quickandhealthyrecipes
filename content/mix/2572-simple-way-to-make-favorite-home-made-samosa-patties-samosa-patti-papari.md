How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
