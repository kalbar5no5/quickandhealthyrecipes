Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!
