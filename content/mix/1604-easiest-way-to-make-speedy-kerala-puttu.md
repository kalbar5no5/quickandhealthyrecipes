Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
