Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
