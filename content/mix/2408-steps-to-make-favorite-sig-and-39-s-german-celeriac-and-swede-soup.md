Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
