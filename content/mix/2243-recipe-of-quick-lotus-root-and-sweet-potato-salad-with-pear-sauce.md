Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
