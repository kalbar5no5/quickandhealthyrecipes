Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
