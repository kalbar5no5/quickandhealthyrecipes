Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
