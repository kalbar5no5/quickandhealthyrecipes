Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
