Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
