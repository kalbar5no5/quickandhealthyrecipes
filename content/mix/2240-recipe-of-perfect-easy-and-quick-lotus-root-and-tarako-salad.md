Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
