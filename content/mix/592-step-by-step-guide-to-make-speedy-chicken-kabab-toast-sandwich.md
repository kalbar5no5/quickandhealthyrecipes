Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
