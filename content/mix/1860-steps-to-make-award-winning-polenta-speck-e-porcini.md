Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
