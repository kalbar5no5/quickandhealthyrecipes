Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
