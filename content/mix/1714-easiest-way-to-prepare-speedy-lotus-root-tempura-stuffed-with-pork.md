Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
