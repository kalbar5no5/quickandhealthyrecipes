Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
