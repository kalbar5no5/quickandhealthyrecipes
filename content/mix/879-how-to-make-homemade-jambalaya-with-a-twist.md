Jambalaya (/ˌdʒæmbəˈlaɪ.ə/ JAM-bə-LY-ə, /ˌdʒʌm-/ JUM-) is a popular dish of West African, French (especially Provençal cuisine), and Spanish influence. Unfortunately, the all-inclusive nature of jambalaya makes it difficult to pair with other dishes. Hush puppies are deep fried cornbread batter, while hot water cornbread is a simple and southern twist on the classic recipe. The four remaining bakers give Hanukkah&#39;s gold-covered chocolate coins a twist. Then, they bake cheesecakes decorated with Guy&#39;s digging into crazy twists on chicken and burgers including doctored-up chicken skins in Delaware, shawarma-stuffed sausages in San Diego. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
