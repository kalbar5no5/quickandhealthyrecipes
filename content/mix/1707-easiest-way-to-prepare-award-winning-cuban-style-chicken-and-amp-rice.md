Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
