Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
