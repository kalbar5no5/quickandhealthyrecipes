Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
