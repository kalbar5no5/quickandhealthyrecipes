Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
