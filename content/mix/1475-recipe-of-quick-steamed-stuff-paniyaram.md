I asked her the recipe and made it immediately and it was a huge success. So why not masala dosa stuff paniyaram in Rasam? Let me know if I am wrong but the idea sounds delicious and let me tell you its taste even better with a side of coconut chutney. I am from the Western part of India but somehow I love South Indian food so much, people say I look alike South Indian too.

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
