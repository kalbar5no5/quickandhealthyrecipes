Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
