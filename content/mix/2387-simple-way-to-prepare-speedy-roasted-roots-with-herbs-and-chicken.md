Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
