Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
