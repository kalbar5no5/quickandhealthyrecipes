Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
