Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
