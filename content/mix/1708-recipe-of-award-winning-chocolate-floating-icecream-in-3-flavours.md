Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
