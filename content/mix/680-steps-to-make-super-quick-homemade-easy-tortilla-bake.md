Heat refried beans to make for easier spreading. This is an easy recipe to make and very good with some salsa. I used olive oil instead, but that was the only change I made. Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with smoked paprika. Place tortillas to cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish (You can break the tortillas to cover the gaps). 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
