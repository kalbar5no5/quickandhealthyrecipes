Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
