How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
