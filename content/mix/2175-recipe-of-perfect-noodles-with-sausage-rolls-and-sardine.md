How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
