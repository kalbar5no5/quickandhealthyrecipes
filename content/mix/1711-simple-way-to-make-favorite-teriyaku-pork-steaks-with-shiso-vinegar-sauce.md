Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
