Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
