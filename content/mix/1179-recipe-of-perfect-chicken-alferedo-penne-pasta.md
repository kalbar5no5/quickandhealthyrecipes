Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
