Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
