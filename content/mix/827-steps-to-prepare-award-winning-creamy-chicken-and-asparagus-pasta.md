Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
