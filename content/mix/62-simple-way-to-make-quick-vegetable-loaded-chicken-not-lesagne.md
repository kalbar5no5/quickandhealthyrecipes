Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
