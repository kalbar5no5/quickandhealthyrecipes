Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
