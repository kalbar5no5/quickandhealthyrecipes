Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
