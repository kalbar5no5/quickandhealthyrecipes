Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
