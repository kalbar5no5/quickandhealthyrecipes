How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
