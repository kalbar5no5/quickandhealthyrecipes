Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
