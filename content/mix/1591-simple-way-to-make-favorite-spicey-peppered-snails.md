Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
