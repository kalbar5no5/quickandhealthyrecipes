Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
