Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
