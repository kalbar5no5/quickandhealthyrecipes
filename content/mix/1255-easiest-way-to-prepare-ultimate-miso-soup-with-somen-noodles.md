Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
