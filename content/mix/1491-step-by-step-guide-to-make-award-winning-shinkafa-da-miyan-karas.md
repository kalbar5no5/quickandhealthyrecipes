Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
