How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
