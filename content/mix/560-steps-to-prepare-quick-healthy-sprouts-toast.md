Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
