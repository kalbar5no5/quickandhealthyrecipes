Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
