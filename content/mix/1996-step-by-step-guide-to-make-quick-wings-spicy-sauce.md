Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
