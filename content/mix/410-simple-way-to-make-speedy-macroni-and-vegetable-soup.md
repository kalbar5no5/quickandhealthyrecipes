Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
