Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
