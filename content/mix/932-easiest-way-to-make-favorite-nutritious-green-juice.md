Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
