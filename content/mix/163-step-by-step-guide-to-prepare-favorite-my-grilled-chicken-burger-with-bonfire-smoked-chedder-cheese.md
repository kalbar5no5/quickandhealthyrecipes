Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
