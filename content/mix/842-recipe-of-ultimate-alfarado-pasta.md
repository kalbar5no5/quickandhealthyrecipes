Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
