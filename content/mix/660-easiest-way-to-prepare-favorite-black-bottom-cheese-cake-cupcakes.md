Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
