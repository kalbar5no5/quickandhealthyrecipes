Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
