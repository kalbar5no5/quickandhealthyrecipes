Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
