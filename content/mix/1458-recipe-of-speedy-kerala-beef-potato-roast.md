Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
