Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
