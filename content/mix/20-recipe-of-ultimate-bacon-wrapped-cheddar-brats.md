Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
