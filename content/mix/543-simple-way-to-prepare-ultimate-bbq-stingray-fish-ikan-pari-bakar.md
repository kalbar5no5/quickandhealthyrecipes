Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
