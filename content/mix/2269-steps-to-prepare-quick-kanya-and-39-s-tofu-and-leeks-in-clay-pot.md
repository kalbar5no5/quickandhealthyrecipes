Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
