Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
