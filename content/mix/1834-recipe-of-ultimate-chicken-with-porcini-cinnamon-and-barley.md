recipeingredient:
- "6 chicken thighs about 1 12 lbs of chicken I used skinless but will use skinon next time and make sure that I cook the chicken until the skin is really crispy"
- "1/2 white onion peeled and diced"
- "2 cloves garlic peeled and finely diced"
- "2 tsps olive oil"
- "1 Tbsp chopped sage"
- "1 tsp chopped thyme leaves"
- "1/2 cinnamon stick"
- "4 slices bacon finely chopped"
- "1/3 cup dried porcini mushrooms"
- "1 cup barley"
- "2 cups boiling water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the dried mushrooms and the cinnamon stick in a bowl. Pour the boiling water over and set aside for at least 30 minutes. I typically do this type of thing in the morning when I am making coffee and then put it in the fridge until I need it at dinner time."
- "Put the barley in a large bowl and cover it with cold water, set aside for about 30 minutes as well. Can also be done in the morning as above. After 30 minutes, rinse the barley very well and put it in a large pan, covered with new water. Bring to a boil, lower heat and cook for 25 minutes. remove from the heat, cover and set aside while you make the chicken. If using pearl (also called soup) barley, skip this step as it needs less cooking time than the hulled barley I used and just add it as is"
- "Put the olive oil, bacon, garlic and onion in a large skillet. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook until the bacon has rendered its fat and the onion is translucent, stirring from time to time, about 3 minutes."
- "Raise heat to medium. Add the chicken to the pan and salt well. Sprinkle with half of the thyme and sage. Sear for a couple of minutes to brown and then turn the chicken, scraping up all the pieces of onion, bacon and garlic to the top so that they don&#39;t burn, and salt again. Sprinkle over the remaining thyme and sage. Cook for an additional couple of minutes to brown the other side of the chicken as well."
- "While the chicken is browning, remove the cinnamom stick and the mushrooms from the mushroom soaking water. Discard the cinnamon stick. Remove any tough or hard pieces from the mushrooms and discard. Chop the remainder. Strain the mushroom stock through a coffee filter and reserve."
- "Lower the heat, remove the chicken to a plate and add the drained barley as well as the chopped mushrooms to the pan in its place. Stir the barley and mushrooms together with the pan juices, bacon and onion."
- "Place the chicken pieces back on top of the barley. Pour over the mushroom stock, cover the pan and cook for 15 to 20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the barley is tender but not mushy. Check barley for salt before serving."

Chicken with Porcini, Cinnamon and Barley I based this recipe on an Ottolenghi one but felt that I wanted something more chewy and substantial than the orzo he used, hence my substitution of barley.

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
