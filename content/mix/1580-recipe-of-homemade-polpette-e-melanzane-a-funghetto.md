Io le ho preparate utilizzando dei magnifici funghi porcini, ma nulla vi vieta di cambire tipologia e usare champignon o altri tipi di funghi a scelta. Un piatto di polpette accompagnato da melanzane a funghetti. Le melanzane a funghetti ( mulignane a fungetiello in Napoletano) sono un contorno tipico della cucina napoletana. Si preparano in due varianti, con e senza pomodoro, cuocendo le melanzane a tocchetti in tegame con aglio e olio.

Le melanzane a funghetti ( mulignane a fungetiello in Napoletano) sono un contorno tipico della cucina napoletana. Si preparano in due varianti, con e senza pomodoro, cuocendo le melanzane a tocchetti in tegame con aglio e olio. Le melanzane a funghetto sono un contorto campano classico e gustoso a base di melanzane fritte e pomodori ramati, ottime anche per condire la pasta. Le melanzane a funghetto, o per essere precisi mulignane a fungitiello sono un contorno tipico napoletano. Trasferitele in un colapasta e spolverizzatele con un po&#39; di sale per far perdere l&#39;acqua di vegetazione, cosÃ¬ non saranno amare. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
