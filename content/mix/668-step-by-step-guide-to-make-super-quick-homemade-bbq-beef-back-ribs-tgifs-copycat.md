Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood.

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood.

These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
