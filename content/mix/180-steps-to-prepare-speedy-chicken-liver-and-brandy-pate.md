Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
