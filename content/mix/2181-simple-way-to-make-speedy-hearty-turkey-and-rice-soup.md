Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
