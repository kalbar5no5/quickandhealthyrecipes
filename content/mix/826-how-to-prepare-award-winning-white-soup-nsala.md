Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
