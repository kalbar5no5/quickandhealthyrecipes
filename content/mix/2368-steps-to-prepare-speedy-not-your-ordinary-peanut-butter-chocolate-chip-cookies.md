Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
