Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
