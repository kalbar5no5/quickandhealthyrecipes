Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
