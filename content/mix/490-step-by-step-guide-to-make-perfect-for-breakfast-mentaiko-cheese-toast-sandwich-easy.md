Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
