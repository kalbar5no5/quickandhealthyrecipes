Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
