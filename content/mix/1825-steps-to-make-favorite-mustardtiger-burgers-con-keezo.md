- "1 lb ground beef"
- "1 egg"
- "2 tsp ground mustard"
- " Garlic salt"
- " Basil"
- "1 dash A1 steak sauce"
- "1 tbsp butter"
- "1/4 yellow onion"
- " Salt  pepper"
- " Your choice of cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "First thing first as always, get all your ingredients together. Dice your onion, decide how much seasoning you want in your burger meat, make a plan."
- "In a large bowl Add the butter, melt it in the microwave. 15 seconds will probably do it. Add the ground beef. Make a hole in the middle. Crack the egg right in the hole you just made. Scramble it up a little with your finger, just so the yolk breaks and its a bit blended. Add the A1 into the egg. Add the seasonings to the meat around the egg. Add the onion just like the seasoning. Get your hands in there and smush and squeeze that mixture till it&#39;s a well blended meat mush."
- "Now you&#39;ll form your patties. 1 lb equals 4 nice thick burgers so try to get 4 even portions of the meat. Work it with your hands and form into patties. They should be about 3/4 inch thick. Salt and pepper the completed patties."
- "This is where you will make or break the burgers. The trick to cooking hamburgers is getting a good sear on them. That means your going to take a lightly oiled pan and put it on high heat.  On a preheated pan you will lay out your burger patties. It will make a LOUD sizzle sound as you place them, that&#39;s a good thing.  Your going to leave them for about 5 minutes. Then flip and do the same. When you flip they should look like the pic... That&#39;s a bee you tee full sear!"
- "Now you are going to actually cook the patties. After you sear the second side, flip them again and lower the heat about halfway and cover.  This is the next key to a good burger. I don&#39;t mean use a pan lid. I use a lid from a pot that&#39;s smaller than my pan to cover only the burgers... Like so.."
- "Depending on how you like your burgers is how long you&#39;ll cook them. If you like them more rare, 3-4 minutes on each side. I like mine more well than rare so I did about 8 minutes each side. VERY important!! Don&#39;t puncture or press the patties! You&#39;re covering them with a lid which does the job that you&#39;d be trying to do by puncturing or pressing. Either one would also defeat the purpose of the sear. You sear to seal in the moisture and flavors."
- "Now is the time you&#39;d put your cheese on the patties if you&#39;re making cheeseburgers. Cover with the lid till cheese is melted. Remove from pan onto a paper towel lined plate. Let stand for at least 5 minuets before cutting or eating. I only put some colbyjack cheese, a bit of raw onion and spicy brown mustard on mine (to make MustardTiger proud) and trust me.. That&#39;s all it needs! Enjoy!"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
