Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
