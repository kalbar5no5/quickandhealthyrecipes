Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
