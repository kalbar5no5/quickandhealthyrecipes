Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
