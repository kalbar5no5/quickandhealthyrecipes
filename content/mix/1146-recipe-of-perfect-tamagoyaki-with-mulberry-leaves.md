Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
