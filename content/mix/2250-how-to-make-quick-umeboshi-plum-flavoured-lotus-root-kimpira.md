Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
