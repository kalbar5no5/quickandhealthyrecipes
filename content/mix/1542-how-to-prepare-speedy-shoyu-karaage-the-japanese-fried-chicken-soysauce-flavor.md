Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
