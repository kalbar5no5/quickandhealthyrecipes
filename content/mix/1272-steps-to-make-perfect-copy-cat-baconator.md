Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
