Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
