Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
