Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
