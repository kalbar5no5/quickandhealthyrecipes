Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
