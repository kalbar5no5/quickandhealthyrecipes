Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
