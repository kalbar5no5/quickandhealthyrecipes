Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
