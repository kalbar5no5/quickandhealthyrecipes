Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
