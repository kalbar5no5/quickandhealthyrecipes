Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
