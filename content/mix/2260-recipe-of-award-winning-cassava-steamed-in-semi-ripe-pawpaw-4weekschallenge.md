Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk.

B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel).

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood.
