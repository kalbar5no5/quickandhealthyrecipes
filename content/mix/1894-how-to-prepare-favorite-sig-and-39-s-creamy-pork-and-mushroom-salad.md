Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
