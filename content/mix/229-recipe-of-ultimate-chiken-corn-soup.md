Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
