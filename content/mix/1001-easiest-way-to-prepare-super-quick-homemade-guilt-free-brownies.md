Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
