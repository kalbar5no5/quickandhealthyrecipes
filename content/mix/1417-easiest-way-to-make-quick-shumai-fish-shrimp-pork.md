How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
