Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
