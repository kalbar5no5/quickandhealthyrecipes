Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
