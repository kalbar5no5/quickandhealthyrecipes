Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
