Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
