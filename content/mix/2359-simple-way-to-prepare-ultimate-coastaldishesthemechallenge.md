Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
