Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
