Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
