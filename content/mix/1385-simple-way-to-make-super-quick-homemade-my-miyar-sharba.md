How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
