Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
