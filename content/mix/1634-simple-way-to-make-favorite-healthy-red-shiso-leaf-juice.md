recipeingredient:
- "300 grams Red shiso leaves"
- "750 ml Water"
- "375 grams Granulated sugar"
- "60 ml Lemon juice concentrate is fine"
recipeinstructions:
- "This is the red shiso sold in the umeboshi (pickled plum) making section of the supermarket. One bag contains 320 to 340 g. If you remove the stems, you&#39;ll have about 300 g of leaves."
- "Only the leaves will be used. Wash well, and pat dry."
- "Juice the lemon. Strain off any pulp. You can use bottled lemon juice, but freshly squeezed juice is best."
- "Put the water and shiso leaves in a pan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to low-medium and simmer for 10 minutes. The volume will decrease, and the leaves will turn green."
- "Strain the liquid through a sieve lined with cotton gauze or a cheesecloth. Press the leaves lightly to extract more liquid."
- "Return the strained liquid to the pan, add sugar and heat again. Mix well to dissolve the sugar and bring to a boil. Skim off any scum."
- "Add the lemon juice, bring back to a boil and turn off the heat. As soon as you add the lemon juice, the liquid will turn a beautiful red color."
- "When the liquid is cool, transfer to a clean storage jar and store in the refrigerator."
- "Dilute with 2-3x water or soda water and enjoy. If you prefer a more concentrated flavor, serve the juice straight on the rocks, and drink it as the ice melts. It&#39;s delicious mixed with shochu (distilled clear liquor)."
- "I made a version with lots of vinegar and less sugar. 300 g red shiso leaves, 1 liter water, 350 g sugar and 150 ml vinegar."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
