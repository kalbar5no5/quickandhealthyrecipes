Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
