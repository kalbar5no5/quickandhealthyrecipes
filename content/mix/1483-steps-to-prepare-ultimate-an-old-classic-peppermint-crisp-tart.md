Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
