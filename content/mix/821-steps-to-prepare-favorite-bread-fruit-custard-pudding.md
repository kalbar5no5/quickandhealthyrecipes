Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
