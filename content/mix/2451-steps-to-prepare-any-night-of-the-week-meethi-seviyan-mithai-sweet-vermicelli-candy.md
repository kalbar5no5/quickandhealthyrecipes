Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
