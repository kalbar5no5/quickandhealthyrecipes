Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
