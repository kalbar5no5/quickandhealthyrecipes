Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
