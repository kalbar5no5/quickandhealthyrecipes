How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
