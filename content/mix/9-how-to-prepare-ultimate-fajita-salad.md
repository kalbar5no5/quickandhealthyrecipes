Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
