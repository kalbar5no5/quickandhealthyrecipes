Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
