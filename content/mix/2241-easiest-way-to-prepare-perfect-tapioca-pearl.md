Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
