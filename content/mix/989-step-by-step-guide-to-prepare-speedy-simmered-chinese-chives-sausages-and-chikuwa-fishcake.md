Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
