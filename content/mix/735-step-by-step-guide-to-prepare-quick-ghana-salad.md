Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
