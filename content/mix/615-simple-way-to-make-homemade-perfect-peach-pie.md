recipeingredient:
- " pie filling"
- "1/4 cup brown sugar"
- "3 tbsp cornstarch"
- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1/4 tsp salt use 18 teaspoon 14 was the smallest option"
- "1/4 tsp ground nutmeg"
- "5 cup sliced peaches"
- "1/2 cup sugar"
- "2 tsp lemon juice"
- "1 tbsp butter"
- " bottom crust"
- "2 1/2 cup flour"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter"
- "2/3 cup shortening"
- "6 tbsp cold water"
- " top crust"
- "2 cup flour"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "3/4 cup unsalted butter"
- "3 tsp sugar"
- "6 tbsp cold water"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make bottom crust, first remember to keep the fat and water as cold as reasonably possible. Combine flour and salt."
- "Cut in butter and shortening until it is a coarse meal. Gradually add in the water until well mixed. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes."
- "Make the top pie crust the same way (using correct ingredients of course) and store in the refrigerator until its time to use it."
- "When placing dough in pan, roll it out between two pieces of plastic wrap. When its about 1/4 inch thick, remove one side of plastic wrap."
- "Use the other piece of plastic wrap to help you keep the crust in one piece while transferring to pie dish. Transfer to pie dish and push out any air bubbles and trim the ends of excess dough. Refrigerate the pie crust until you are ready to fill it and bake it."
- "Here&#39;s an efficient way to cut up the peaches."
- "Combine brown and granulated sugars in a large bowl. Toss in the peaches so they are all well coated in sugar. Let this sit for one hour."
- "When the time comes, drain the juice from the peaches but make sure you save it!"
- "Combine cornstarch, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt in a small saucepan. Stir in the juice from the peaches. Bring to a boil and cook for a few minutes or until sauce thickens. Stir frequently."
- "Take the saucepan off heat. Add in lemon juice and butter. Once its well mixed, pour back into peaches and combine."
- "Pour peaches into pie crust. Decorate the top of the pie however you would like. I experimented with the lattice, braids, cut outs, and funky layers. Be creative!"
- "Bake for about 55 minutes (25 if you&#39;re making a mini pie) at 400°F. Crust should be golden and if you can see the filling it should be just a little bit bubbly."
- "The difference between the top and bottom pie crust recipes is in the proportions of butter to shortening. The bottom uses less butter so it doesn&#39;t taste quite as good, but it will be flakier. The top is supposed to taste a little bit better (I didn&#39;t notice a difference honestly), but will be less flakey and can therefore be better for making small details in your pie. You can use either for either the top or bottom, this is just how I did it and I was very happy with it! Whichever one you are using, its still important to keep the dough cold, or the fat and water react and it won&#39;t turn out as well after you finish baking it."

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
