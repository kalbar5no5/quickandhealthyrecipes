Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
