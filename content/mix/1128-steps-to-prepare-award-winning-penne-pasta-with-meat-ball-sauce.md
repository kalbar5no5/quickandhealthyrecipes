Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
