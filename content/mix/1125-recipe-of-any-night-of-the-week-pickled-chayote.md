Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
