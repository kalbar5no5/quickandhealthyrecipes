Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
