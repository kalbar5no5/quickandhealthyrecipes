Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
