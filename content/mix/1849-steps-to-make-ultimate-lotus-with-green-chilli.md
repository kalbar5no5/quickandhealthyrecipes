Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
