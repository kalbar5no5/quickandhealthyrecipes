Spoon the remaining herb butter mixture over fish. I also use a pastry brush to lightly tap the tops of the breaded fish to make sure it is all cover. You may need to melt more butter to coat fish. Fish is done when fish flakes easily with a fork.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
