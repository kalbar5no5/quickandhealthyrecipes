Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
