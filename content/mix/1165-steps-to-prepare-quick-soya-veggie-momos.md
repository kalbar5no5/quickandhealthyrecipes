Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
