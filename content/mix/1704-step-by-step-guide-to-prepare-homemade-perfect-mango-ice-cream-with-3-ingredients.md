Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk.

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood.

Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine.
