Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
