How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
