Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
