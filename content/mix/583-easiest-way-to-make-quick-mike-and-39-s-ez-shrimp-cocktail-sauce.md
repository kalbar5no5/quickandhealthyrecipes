Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
