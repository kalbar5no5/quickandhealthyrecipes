After talking with the locals, I learnt that bajra is a hardy crop grows well, even in drought conditions, high temperatures and low soil fertility, which is probably why.

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
