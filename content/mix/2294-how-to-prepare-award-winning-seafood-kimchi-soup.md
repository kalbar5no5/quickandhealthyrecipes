Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
