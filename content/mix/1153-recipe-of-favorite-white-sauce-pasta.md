Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
