Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
