Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
