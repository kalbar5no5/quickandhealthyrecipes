Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
