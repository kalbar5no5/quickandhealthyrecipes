Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
