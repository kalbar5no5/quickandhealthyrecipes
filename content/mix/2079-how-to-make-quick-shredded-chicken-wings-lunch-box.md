How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
