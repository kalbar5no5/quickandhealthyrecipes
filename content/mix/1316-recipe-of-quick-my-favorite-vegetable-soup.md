Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
