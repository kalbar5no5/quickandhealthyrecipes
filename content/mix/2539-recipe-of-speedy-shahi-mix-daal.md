Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
