Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
