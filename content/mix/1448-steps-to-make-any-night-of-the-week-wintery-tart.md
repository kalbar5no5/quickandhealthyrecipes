Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
