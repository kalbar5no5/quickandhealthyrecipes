Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
