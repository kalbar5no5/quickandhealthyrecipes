Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
