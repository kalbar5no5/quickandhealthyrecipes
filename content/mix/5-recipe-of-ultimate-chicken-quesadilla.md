Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body.
