Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
