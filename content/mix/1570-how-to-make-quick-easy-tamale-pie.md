Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
