Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
