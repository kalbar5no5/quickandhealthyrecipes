Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
