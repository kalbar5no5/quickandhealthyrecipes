Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
