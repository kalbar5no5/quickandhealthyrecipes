Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
