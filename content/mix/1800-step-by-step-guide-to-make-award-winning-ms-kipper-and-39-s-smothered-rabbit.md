Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
