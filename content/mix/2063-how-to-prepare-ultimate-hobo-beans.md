Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
