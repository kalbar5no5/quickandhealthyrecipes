Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
