Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
