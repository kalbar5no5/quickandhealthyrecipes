Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
