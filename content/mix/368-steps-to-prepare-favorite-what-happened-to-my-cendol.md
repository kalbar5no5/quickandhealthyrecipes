- "As soon as you see bubbles start to form along the edge, add in the bloomed gelatine.  Stir to combine well and remove from heat.  Ladle the mixture slowly and gradually into the yolk mixture while still whisking to temper the yolks."
- "Keep ladling until the mixture is fully incorporated.  Set aside to cool down slightly.  In a separate bowl, using a hand mixer, whip cream until stiff peaks form.  Fold the whipped cream into the yolk mixture in 1/3 portions.  Fold until well combined."
- "Transfer the mixture into the sphere mold.  You should have 4 spheres.  Freeze in the freezer preferably overnight."
- "Prepare the mirror glaze.  Prepare the glaze a day in advance.  Bloom gelatine powder with 1 TBSP of hot water in a small bowl.  Stir to dissolve the gelatine and set aside.  In a sauce pot over medium low heat, add water, sugar and condensed milk.  Stir to combine well and until the sugar has dissolved."

- "Allow the mixture to boil for about 4 to 6 mins.  Drain off the water thru a strainer.  Return the beans into the sauce pot.  Add in more than enuff water, about 500ml, to fully submerge the beans.  Bring it up to a boil."
- "Lower the heat down to a simmer.  Allow the mixture to simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hrs or until the beans are soft and easily squashed by your fingers.  *Add in more water if needed, during the simmering process.*  Transfer into a blender."

- "Add in the remaining 15g of white chocolate.  Stir until completely melted. This is to temper the white chocolate.  To create that curl effect, I use a thicker piece of paper and roll it to create a curve.  Using a paint brush, brush the tempered chocolate onto a parchment paper."
- "Brush to resemble leaves. A total of 12 leaves.  Place the parchment paper over the curled thick paper.  Set aside in the fridge until completely chilled.  Once chilled, brush a thick dot on a parchment paper."
- "Place the 3 leaves onto the dot to resemble a flower pod.  Repeat the process for the remaining leaves.  Set aside in the fridge until completely chilled.  *Pls tuned in my Instagram highlights for better visual.*"
- "Assembly and serve.  Melt the mirror glaze on a double boiler.  Unmold the frozen mousse spheres onto a cooling rack over a sheet pan.  Pour the mirror glaze over the spheres.  Let the glazed sphere sit for while for the mirror glaze to set and scrape off any excess droplets."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
