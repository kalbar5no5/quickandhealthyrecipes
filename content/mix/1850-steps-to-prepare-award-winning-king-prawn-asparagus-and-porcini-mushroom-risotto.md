How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
