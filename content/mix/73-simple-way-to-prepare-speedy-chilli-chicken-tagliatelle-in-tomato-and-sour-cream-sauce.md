Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
