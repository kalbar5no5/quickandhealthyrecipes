Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
