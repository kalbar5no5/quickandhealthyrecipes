Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
