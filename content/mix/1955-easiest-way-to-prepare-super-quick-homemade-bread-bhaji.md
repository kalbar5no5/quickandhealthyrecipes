Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
