Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
