Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
