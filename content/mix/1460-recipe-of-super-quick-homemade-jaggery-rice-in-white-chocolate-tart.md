Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
