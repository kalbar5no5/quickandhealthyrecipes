Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
