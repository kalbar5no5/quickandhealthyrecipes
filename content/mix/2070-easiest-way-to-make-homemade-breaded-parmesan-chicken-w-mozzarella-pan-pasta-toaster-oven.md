Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
