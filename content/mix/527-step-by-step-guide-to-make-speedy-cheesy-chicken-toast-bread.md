Blend butter, garlic, and cheeses until smooth. Spread mixture over the unbuttered sides of the toast and bake until bubbly and crisp! Grate the Cheddar cheese using a large hole grater â€•if you use a small hole, the cheese will melt too quickly before the bread has toasted. Divide the cheese between two slices of bread, placing it on the unbuttered side. Season with a little salt and pepper to taste. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
