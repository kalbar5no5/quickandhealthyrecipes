Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
