Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
