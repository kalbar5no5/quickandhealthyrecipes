Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
