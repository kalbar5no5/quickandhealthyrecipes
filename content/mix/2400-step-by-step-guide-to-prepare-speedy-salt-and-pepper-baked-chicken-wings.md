Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
