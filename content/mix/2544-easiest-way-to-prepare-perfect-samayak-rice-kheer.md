Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
