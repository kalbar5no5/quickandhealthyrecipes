Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
