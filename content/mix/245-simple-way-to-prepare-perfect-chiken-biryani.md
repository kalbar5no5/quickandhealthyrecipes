Photography Credit: Prerna Singh Simple Chicken Biryani for Beginners In India, the eternal favourite for a special Sunday lunch or a party dish is definitely a perfectly layered Chicken Biryani, dum cooked to perfection! And it&#39;s a visual delight too - a beautiful array of long-grained rice, tender chicken and pungent spices studded with fresh mint and coriander, topped with fried onions and boiled egg wedges. Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. 

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
