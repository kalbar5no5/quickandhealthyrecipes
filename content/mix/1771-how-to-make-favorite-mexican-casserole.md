recipeingredient:
- "2 pounds ground beef"
- "1 cup chopped onion"
- "1 can cream of mushroom soup"
- "1 can cream of chicken soup"
- "1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chilis"
- "1 (10 ounce) can mild enchilada sauce"
- "1 jar taco sauce"
- "1 pound shredded cheddar cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Brown the hamburger meat with onions. Drain off any excess fat. When the meat is done mix in the taco sauce and enchilada sauce and cook on medium heat another 5/6 until heated."
- "In a saucepan mix together the cream of chicken and mushroom soups, and green chili’s with one cup of milk (I just fill up one of the soup can full of milk and that’s about a cup). Cook on medium high heat making sure you stir it frequently so it doesn’t stick to the bottom of pan. It doesn’t take long to cook. Maybe 5/6 minutes."
- "In a 9x13 baking dish put a small portion of the hamburger mixture on the bottom and spread (this is so the corn tortillas won’t stick to bottom). Then a layer of corn tortillas. Next put a layer of the hamburger mixture. Now put a layer of the soup mixture and spread."
- "Next put a layer of shredded cheese. Repeat these layers of corn tortillas, hamburger mixture, soup mixture then cheese. You will probably have enough for 3-4 layer. (I usually do 3 layers)"
- "Top with shredded cheese and cover with foil. I make sure the foil is a little bubbled so it doesn’t stick to the cheese."
- "Bake at 350 for 30 minutes with the foil on. Then take the foil off and bake another 10-15 minutes until cheese is slightly browned."
- "Let stand 10-15 minutes and enjoy!"

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
