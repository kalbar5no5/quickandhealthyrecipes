Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
