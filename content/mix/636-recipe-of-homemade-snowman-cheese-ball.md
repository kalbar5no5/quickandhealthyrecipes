Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
