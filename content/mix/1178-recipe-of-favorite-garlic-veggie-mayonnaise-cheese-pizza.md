Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
