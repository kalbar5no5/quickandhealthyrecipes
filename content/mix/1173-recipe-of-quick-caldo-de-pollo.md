Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
