Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
