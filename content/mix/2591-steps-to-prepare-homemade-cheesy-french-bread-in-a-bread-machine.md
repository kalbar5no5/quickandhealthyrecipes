Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
