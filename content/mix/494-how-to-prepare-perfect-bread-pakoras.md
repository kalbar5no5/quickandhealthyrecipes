Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
