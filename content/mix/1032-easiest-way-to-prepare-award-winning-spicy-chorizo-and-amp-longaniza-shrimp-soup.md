Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
