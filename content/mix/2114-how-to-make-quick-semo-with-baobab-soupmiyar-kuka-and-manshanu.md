Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
