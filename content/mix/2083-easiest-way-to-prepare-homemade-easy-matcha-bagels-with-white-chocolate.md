How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
