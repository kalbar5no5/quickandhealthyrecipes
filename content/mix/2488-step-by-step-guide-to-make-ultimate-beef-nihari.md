How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
