I just love the flavour of the sea. Pasta with mussels is usually a dish I make at weekends simply because the mussels need to be really fresh and therefore bought on the same day but, as this is an easy dish and of quick preparation, you could certainly make it during the week if you wish. It is incredible how a few mussels can magically transform a simple tomato sauce in a perfumed and. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
