How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
