Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
