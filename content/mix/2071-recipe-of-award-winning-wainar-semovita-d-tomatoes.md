Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
