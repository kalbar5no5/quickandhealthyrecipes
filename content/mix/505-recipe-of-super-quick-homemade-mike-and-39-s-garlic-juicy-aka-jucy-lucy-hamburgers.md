Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
