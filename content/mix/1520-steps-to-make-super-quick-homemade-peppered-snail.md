Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
