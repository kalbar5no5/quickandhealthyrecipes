Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
