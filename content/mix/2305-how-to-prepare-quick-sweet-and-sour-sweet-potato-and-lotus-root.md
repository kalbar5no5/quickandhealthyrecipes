Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
