Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
