Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
