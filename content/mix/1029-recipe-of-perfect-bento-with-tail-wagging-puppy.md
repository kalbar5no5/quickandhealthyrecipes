A dog&#39;s body and tail position act as an emotional meter. A horizontal tail indicates an attentive, alert dog. The higher the tail posture moves, the more threatening it becomes, with a vertical tail personifying dominance. Tail movement adds meaning to the position. Wagging speed indicates how excited a dog is, while. &#34;Tail wagging is what a lot of people look at the most for gauging whether a dog is friendly or not, and even veterinarians rely on it, but this often isn&#39;t very helpful.&#34; You should view a wagging tail as a sign of willingness to interact, says Radosta, but not a signal of a particular mood or state. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
