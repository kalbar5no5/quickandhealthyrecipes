How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
