Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
