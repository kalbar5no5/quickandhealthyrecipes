Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
