Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
