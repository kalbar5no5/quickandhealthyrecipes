Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
