Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
