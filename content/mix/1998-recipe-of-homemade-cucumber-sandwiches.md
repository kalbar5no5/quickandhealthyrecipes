Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
