Chicken has its own wonderful taste. Like other chicken dishes, it also tastes good in samosa. It&#39;s recipe consists on two parts. Homemade chicken samosa is far much better tasting than the store-bought samosas. In my opinion, some samosas sold in the stores or even served in restaurants, are full of overcooked spices, and the pastry is either tasteless or soggy, which can make anyone refrain from trying this appetizing snack again. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
