Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
