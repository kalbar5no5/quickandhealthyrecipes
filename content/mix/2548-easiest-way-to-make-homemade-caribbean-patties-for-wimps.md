Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
