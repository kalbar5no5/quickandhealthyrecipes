Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
