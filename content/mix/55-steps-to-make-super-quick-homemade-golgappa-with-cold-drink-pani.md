Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
