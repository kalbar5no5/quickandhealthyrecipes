Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
