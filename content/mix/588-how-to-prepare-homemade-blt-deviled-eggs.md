Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
