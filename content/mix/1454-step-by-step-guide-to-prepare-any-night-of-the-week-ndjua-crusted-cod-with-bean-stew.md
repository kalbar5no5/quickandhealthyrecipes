Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
