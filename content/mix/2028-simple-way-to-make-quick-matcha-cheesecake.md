Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
