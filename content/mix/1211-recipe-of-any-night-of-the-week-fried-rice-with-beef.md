Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
