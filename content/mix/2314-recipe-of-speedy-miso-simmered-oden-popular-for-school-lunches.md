Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
