Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
