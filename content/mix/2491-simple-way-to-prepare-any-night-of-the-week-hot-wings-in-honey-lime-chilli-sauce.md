Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
