Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
