Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
