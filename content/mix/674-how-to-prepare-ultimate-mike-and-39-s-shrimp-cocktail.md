Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
