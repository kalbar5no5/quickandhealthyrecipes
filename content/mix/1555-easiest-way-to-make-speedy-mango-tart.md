The recipe includes step by step photos for how to make a beautiful mango flower. I&#39;ve spent the past week acclimating to the (gorgeous) San Diego weather, getting some sun on my skin (that it had seriously been missing. If you&#39;ve ever lived in or traveled to the southern California city of Del Mar, chances are you&#39;ve heard of Urban Pi&#39;s mango tart. I had my first slice of the restaurant&#39;s legendary dessert way back in high school, and it&#39;s only taken me two decades to muster up the culinary courage to tackle a DIY version at home. When tart shell is completely cool, fill with lime curd using a small offset spatula to smooth top. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
