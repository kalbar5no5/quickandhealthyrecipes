Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
