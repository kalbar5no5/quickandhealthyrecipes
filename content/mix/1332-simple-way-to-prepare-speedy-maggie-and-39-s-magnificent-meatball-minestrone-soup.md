Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
