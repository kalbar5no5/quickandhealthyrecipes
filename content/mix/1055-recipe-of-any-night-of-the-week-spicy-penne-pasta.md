Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
