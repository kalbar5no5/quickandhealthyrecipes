Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
