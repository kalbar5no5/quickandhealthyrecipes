Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
