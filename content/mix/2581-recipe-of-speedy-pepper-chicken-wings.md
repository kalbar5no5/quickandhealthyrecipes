Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
