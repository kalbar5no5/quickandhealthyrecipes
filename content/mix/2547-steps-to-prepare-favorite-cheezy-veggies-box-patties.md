Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
