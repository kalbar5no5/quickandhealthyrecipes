Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
