Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
