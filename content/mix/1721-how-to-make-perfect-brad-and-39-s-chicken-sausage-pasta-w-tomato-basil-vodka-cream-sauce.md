Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
