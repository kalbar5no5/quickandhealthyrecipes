How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
