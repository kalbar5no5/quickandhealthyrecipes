Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
