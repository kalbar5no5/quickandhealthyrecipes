Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
