Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
