- "180 ml Water"
- "1 Chocolate bar"
- "1 tsp Instant dry yeast"
- " Toppings"
- "1 White chocolate strawberry chocolate etc"
- "1 Silver dragees chocolate sprinkles a chocolate decorating pen etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "Finely chop the chocolate bar."
- "Depending on your bread maker, the size that you chop the chocolate into will determine how it will appear in the bread after the first rising. You are welcome to alter the size of the chocolate pieces to your liking."
- "Add all the ingredients except for the yeast into the bread pan. Put the yeast into the yeast compartment of the bread maker and press the start button."
- "Because the baking settings change depending on the bread machine, choose the setting that allows you to remove the dough after the first rising and shape it as you like."
- "When the selected program is complete (at the end of the first rising), remove the dough from the bread machine."
- "Weigh the dough, divide it into 10 portions, and roll them into balls. The dough weighs about 540 g in total, so you can make 10 portions of about 54 g each."
- "To prevent the dough from drying out, cover them with a wet tea towel and leave for 10 minutes, Allowing the dough to rise."
- "Press down evenly on each bun between your hands or on a work surface to deflate them."
- "Roll the deflated bun into a ball once more. Place it into a paper muffin cup, seam side down. Repeat with all 10 buns."

- "Cover the buns with plastic wrap, and let rise for 15 minutes at 40℃.  Preheat the oven to 40℃ to rise the dough."
- "After rising for 15 minutes in the oven, allow the dough to rise for another 10-15 minutes at room temperature. This is because the oven needs to be preheated for baking, so let the dough finish rising at room temperature."
- "Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C. Start preheating the oven as soon as you remove the baking sheet with the dough on it."
- "The dough has finished rising when it has expanded to fill 70-80% of each paper muffin cup. You will achieve the same result if you let it rise at room temperature for the entire second rising."
- "Bake for approximately 14 minutes at 375°F/190°C. Transfer the baked buns to a cooling rack. When they&#39;ve cooled down, they&#39;re done!"
- "If your bread machine requires you to add the dry yeast directly into the bread pan with the flour, please be sure to prevent the salt and the yeast from touching."
- "Variations! From this step onwards you will be shown how to decorate them."
- "Place the chocolate bar on a heat-proof dish and use the residual heat of the oven to melt it. You can also melt the chocolate in a double boiler."
- "Gently stir the chocolate after it has finished melting, flip the bun upside down, and dip the top in the chocolate."
- "For this Valentine&#39;s Day themed recipe, I melted white and strawberry chocolatand used cute white and pink toppings."
- "If you are decorating them with silver dragees or sprinkles, do so while the chocolate is still wet."
- "If you are using a chocolate decorating pen, I would suggest waiting until the chocolate dries to decorate the buns."
- "And now these one-of-a-kind cute chocolate buns are complete! My three year old son helped me decorate these."
- "Suggestion: Decorating the buns with chocolate and toppings can make it sweeter, so I used dark chocolate in the dough. Please use whichever chocolate you prefer."

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
