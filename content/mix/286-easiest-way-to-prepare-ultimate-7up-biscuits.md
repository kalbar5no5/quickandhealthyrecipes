Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
