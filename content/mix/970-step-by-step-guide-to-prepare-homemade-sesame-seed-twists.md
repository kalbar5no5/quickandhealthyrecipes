Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
