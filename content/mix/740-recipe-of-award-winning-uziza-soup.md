Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
