Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
