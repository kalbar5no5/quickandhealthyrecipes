Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
