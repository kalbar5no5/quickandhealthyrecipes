How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
