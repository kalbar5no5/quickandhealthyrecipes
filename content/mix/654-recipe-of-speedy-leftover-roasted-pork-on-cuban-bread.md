Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
