recipeingredient:
- "5 lb Whole or first cut or top cut brisket  could be 45 lbs"
- "2 large or 4 smaller onions sliced thinly"
- "8 Carrots sliced on diagonal or even more if you wish"
- "1/2 Bottle of red wine if whole cut  Add whole bottle if dryer top cut"
- "1 Pepper sprinkled on both sides"
- "1 Garlic powder sprinkled on both sides"
- "1 Dried thyme sprinkled on both sides"
- "1 Onion powder sprinkled on both sides"
- "8 Allspice berries"
- "3 Bay leaves"
- "1/2 envelope Onion soup mix"
- "8 Mushrooms washed and quartered"
- "8 oz Can tomato paste"
- "1 Very small amount of olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you have a whole cut, ask butcher to trim some fat off.  If not, trim it yourself.  Leave a thin layer for flavor.   Wash and dry brisket.  Sprinkle pepper, garlic, onion powder and thyme over both sides of brisket.  Put small amount of olive oil in bottom of roaster.  If necessary, slice brisket in half to fit.  Note:  after its done, brisket will have shrunk about 1/5-1/4, so judge whether you need to cut it.  Turn burners on stove onto medium, and place roaster on burners.  Brown brisket on both sides.  If your roaster isn&#39;t flame-proof, brown it in something that is."
- "Place sliced onions on bottom of roaster, and place brisket on top of it.  Sprinkle carrots and mushrooms (if using) under, and around brisket.  Sprinkle onion soup mix over meat.  Pour red wine over all.  Spoon tomato paste around brisket, and mix with wine as best you can.  Add remaining ingredients around meat.  Take sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil, and seal tightly all around.  Place in 350°F oven for 90 minutes, and take out, open and flip.  Check liquid level.  If it seems to be drying out, or at some time in oven smells like it is (burning smell), add more Warner or beef broth."
- "After first 90 minutes, flip and bake for another 90 minutes.  Take out of oven after 3 hours, and cool for 10 minutes or so.  Take out of pan and place on cutting board with runnels to catch the liquid.  Brisket now needs to be sliced  across the grain.  If you have doubts as to where this is, ask butcher when you first purchase it.  Slice meat thinly, and place each on plate.  When done. Slide. Slicers into liquid and recover with foil tightly.  Bake for 1 hour more."
- "It is best to make this the day before, and refrigerate overnight.  You can lift off any fat very easily.  I always slice, then refrigerate overnight, and finish the the last hour of cooking tome on the day I want to serve it.  Delicious, even when it falls apart.  I even freeze any leftover gravy to use later.  Serves approximately 10-12, especially if you have a 5lb.brisket. Takes 4 hours in total"

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
