Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
