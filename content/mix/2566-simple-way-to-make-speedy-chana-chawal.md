Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
