Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
