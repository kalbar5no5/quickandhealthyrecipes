Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
