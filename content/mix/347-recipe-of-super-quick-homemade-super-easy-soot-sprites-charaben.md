Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
