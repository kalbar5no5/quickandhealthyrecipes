Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
