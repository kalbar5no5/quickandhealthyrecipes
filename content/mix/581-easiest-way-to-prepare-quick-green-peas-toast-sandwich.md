Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
