Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
