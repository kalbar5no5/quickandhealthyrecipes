Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
