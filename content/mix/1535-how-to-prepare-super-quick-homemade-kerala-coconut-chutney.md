Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body.
