Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
