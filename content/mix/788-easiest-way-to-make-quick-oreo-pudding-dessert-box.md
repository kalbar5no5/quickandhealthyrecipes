Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
