Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
