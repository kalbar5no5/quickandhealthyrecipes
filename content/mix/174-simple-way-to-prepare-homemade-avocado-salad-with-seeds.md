Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
