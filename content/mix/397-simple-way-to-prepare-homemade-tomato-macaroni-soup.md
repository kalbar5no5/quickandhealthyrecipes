Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
