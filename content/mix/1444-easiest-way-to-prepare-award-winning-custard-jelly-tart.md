Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
