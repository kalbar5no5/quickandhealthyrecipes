Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
