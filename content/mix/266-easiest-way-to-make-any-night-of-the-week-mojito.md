Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
