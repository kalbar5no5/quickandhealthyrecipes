Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
