Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
