Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
