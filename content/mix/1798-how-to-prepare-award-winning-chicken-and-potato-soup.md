Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
