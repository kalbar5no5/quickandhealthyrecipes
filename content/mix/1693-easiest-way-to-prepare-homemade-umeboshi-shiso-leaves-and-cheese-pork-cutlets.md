Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
