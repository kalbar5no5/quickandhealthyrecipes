How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
