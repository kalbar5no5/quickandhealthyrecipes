Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
