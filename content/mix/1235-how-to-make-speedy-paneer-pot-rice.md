Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
