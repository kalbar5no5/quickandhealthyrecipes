Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
