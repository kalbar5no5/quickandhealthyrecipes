How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
