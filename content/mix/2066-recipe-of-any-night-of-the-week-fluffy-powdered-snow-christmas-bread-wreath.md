recipeingredient:
- "180 grams Bread strong flour"
- "20 grams Cake flour"
- "15 grams Sugar"
- "2 1/2 grams Salt"
- "150 ml Milk"
- "20 grams Unsalted butter"
- "3 grams Instant Dry Yeast"
- "1 Nuts"
- "1 Rice flour for the finishing touch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add all of the ingredients, except the nuts and butter, into the bread machine and start the &#34;bread dough&#34; course. (The yeast goes in a separate opening). After 10 minutes, add the butter."
- "When the dough is finished, separate it into 2 round balls and place with the seam on the bottom. Cover with a damp towel and leave for 20 minutes."
- "When the resting time is over, turn them over and use your hand to remove the gas, while at the same time flattening, moving from the center to the outside."
- "Fold from the top about 4 times. At this time, use your fingers to push on the opposite side to get rid of excess gas."
- "When it forms into the shape of a sea cucumber, use both hands to roll the dough into a long cylinder. 1 cylinder is about 80 cm, but since it&#39;s difficult to stretch it out in one go..."
- "if it becomes difficult to stretch out at around 40 cm, cover it with a damp towel and let it rest a little bit. It will then become easier to roll out."
- "Put the seam side on the bottom and connect one end of each of the 2 cylinders tightly together."
- "Place one strand over the other strand and repeat, essentially forming a twisting pattern, until the end. Lastly, close the ends tightly."
- "Line a baking tray with parchment paper, place the wreath in the shape of a wreath, tightly closing the ends together. Perform the secondary fermentation at 40째C for 20 minutes."
- "Wrap the outsides of a cocotte mold, or something similar, with parchment paper, and place in the middle of the bread dough to hold the round shape. (The center hold of the wreath will shrink, but you don&#39;t need to use the cocotte if you don&#39;t want to.)"
- "I also made small bread (4 wreaths), separated the dough into 8 balls and followed the same procedure. I tried to make the wreath shape without placing a cocotte in the middle."
- "After fermenting the second time, lightly spread water on the dough&#39;s surface with a brush. Add nuts etc, and push them in so they stick on the dough."
- "Using a tea strainer, lightly sprinkle the rice flour evenly and thoroughly onto the dough&#39;s surface, like a light snowfall. (If you don&#39;t have rice flour, bread flour is fine, too.)"
- "In an oven preheated to 180째C, bake for 15 minutes and it&#39;s finished. Refer to Step 16 if you used a cocotte while baking."
- "Cover and decorate the seam on the top with a Christmas ornament and it&#39;s all finished."
- "If you used a cocotte in the center of the wreath, it will be difficult for the center to bake through, so after about 10 minutes of baking, remove the cocotte and continue baking until the time is up."

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
