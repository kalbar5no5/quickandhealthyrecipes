Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
