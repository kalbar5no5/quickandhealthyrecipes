recipeingredient:
- "1 block Tofu"
- "5 small deep fried bean curd or koage"
- "3 tbsp Hijiki seaweed"
- "150 grams Ground meat"
- "4 cm Carrot"
- " Sauce ingredients"
- "4 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "5 tbsp Sake"
- "1 Ginger"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get rid of the surface oil on the fried bean curd by boiling them for 1 to 2 minutes and draining them on a sieve until cooled. Wash the hijiki seaweed and rehydrate in plenty of water to cover until softened."
- "Put the tofu, hijiki seaweed, ground meat and finely julienned carrot in a bowl and mix well together with your hands in the same way you&#39;d mix hamburger meat."
- "Add the flavoring ingredients - soy sauce, sugar, sake, and grated ginger - in a pan. Stuff the fried bean curd with the mixture from step 2 and line up the filled pockets in the pan. Start cooking over high heat, and when it comes to a boil lower the heat and simmer gently for about 10 minutes."
- "The pockets will become nice and puffy. Poke one of the pockets in the middle of the filling with a chopstick, and if the liquid runs clear they are done. Take the pockets out of the pan, leaving the cooking liquid."
- "Thicken the liquid with katakuriko dissolved in water (not listed). It&#39;ll be better if the sauce is a bit on the thick and creamy side."

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
