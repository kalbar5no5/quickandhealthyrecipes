Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
