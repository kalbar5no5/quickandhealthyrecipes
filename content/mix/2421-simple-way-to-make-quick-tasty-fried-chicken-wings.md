Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
