Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
