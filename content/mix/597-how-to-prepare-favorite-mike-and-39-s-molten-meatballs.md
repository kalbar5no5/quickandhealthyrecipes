Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
