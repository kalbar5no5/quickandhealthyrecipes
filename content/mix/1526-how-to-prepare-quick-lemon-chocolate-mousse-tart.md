Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
