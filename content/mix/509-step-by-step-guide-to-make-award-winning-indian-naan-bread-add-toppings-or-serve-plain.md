- "200 grams Bread strong flour"

- " The following toppings for the naan are optional and can be omitted"
- "1 tsp Cumin seeds"
- "1 tsp Grated garlic"
- "1 handful Fresh coriander cilantro leaves"

recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the dry yeast into water which is a bit hotter than body temperature. Add the sugar, mix over a pan of hot water to dissolve, and leave in a warm place."
- "In the meantime, mix the bread flour, salt and baking powder together. You don&#39;t have to sift them, but you can if you want to."
- "Add the yogurt and oil to the flours and mix lightly. Check if the water with the dry yeast is foamy."
- "Add the dry yeast liquid to the bowl and knead until the dough is smooth and no longer sticks to your hands. This takes a bit less than 10 minutes."
- "Form the dough into a ball. Oil your hands and rub the oil on the surface of the dough. Leave to rise for 30 minutes to an hour in a warm place."
- "While the dough is rising, you can make the curry, chop up the coriander leaves to top the naan and so on. Melt the butter, too."
- "When the dough is puffy and risen, divide it into 3 pieces. Flour a work surface. Roll out each piece of dough with a rolling pin."
- "Roll out the dough with a rolling pin, If the dough is too thin it will be tough, so make it about 1 cm or so thick. To make a plain naan, go on to Step 11."
- "Spread the melted butter over the surface of the dough with a spoon. Decide on your toppings. I recommend cumin seeds and fresh coriander leaves."
- "Add your chosen toppings/spices (I used coriander leaves this time) evenly over the surface. Press them in lightly."
- "Bake in a preheated toaster oven at 220°C for 3-4 minutes. Keep an eye on the toaster oven as you roll out the next piece of dough."
- "Done. Repeat steps 8 to 11 for all the pieces of dough. If you use an oven you can bake all 3 pieces at once, and it will be more naan-like."
- "The naan will puff up. You can also cook them in a non-stick frying pan."
- "For a plain naan, bake without adding melted butter. When the plain naan are baked, spread a little butter on them."
- "Naan with cumin seeds smells fantastic."

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
