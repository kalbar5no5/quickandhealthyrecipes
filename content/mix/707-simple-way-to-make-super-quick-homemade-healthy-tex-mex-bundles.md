Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
