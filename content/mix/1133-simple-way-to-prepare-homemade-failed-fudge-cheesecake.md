Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
