Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
