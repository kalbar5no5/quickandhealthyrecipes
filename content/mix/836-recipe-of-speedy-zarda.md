Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, zarda. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Zarda Bar-B-Q has &#34;the best barbecue ribs, brisket and turkey in Kansas City,&#34; says one BBQ customer on Yelp. Another raves, &#34;The most tender burnt ends I&#39;ve had in KC so far.&#34; And, &#34;Delicious thick fries, yummy crispy fried pickles, and the meat is always so tender.&#34; A customer on Urban Spoon writes, &#34;Zarda has this amazing. Zarda (Hindi: ज़र्दा, Urdu: زردہ ‎, Bengali: জর্দা) is a traditional boiled sweet rice dish, native to the Indian subcontinent, with (orange) food coloring, milk and sugar, and flavoured with cardamoms, raisins, saffron, pistachios or almonds. Zarda, commonly known as Power Princess, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Zarda is one of the most well liked of current trending meals on earth. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions daily. They're nice and they look wonderful. Zarda is something that I have loved my entire life.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook zarda using 10 ingredients and 1 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

Zarda is a traditional sweet rice dessert originated from the Mughals. The name Zarda is derived from the Persian and Urdu term &#39;Zard&#39; meaning yellow. The dish gets its name as it is prepared using yellow color. (Source:wiki) Zarda also known as meethe chawal is usually prepared during special occasions like weddings, festivals and celebrations. Zarda is best served warm and I love it with a very strong cup of unsweetened tea after dinner.

The dish gets its name as it is prepared using yellow color. (Source:wiki) Zarda also known as meethe chawal is usually prepared during special occasions like weddings, festivals and celebrations. Zarda is best served warm and I love it with a very strong cup of unsweetened tea after dinner. The recipe I&#39;ve seen the women in my family use is very long and complicated, some involving boiling the rice separately and making a &#39; chashni &#39;, a sugar syrup infused with the cardamom and food colouring to pour over the plain rice seperately. Zarda is the Zimbabwe representative of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease International. Zarda is dedicated to improving the quality of life of people with dementia and those affected by it. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
