Thai green curry: home-cooked vs. street food. Thai green curry is a type of Thai curry that was never really my favorite to eat in Bangkok. That&#39;s because when you order green curry (แกงเขียวหวาน gaeng keow wan) on the streets, it can sometimes (not always) be watery, overly sweet, and even bland (there are many exceptions no doubt, but I&#39;m talking in general). You can easily sub the prawns here also for another protein! Add the curry paste and then the coconut milk and bring to the boil. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
