How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
