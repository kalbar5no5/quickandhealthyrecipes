Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
