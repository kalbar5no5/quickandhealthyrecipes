Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
