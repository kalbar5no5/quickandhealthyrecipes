Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
