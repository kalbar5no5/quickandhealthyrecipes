Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
