Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
