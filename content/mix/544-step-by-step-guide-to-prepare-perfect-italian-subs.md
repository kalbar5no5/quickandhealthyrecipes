How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
