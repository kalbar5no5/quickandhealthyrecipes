Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
