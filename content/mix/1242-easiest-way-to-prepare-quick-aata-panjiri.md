Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
