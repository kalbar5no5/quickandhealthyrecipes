How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
