Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
