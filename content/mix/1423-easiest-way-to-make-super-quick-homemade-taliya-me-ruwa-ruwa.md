Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
