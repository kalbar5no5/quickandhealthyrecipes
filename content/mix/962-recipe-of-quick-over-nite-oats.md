Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
