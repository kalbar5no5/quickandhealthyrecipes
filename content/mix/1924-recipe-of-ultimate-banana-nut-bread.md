Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
