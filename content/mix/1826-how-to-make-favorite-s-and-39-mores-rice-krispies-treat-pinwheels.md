Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
