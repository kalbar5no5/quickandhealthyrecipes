Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
