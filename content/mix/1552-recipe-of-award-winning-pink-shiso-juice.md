Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
