Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
