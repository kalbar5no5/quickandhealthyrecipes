Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
