Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
