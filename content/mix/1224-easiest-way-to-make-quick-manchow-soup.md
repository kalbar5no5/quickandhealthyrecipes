Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
