How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
