Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
