Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
