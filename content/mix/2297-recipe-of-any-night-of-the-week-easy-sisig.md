Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
