Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
