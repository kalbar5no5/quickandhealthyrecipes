Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
