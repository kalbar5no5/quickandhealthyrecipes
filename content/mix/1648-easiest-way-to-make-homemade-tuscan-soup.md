Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, tuscan soup. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Tuscan Soup is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. They are nice and they look fantastic. Tuscan Soup is something that I have loved my entire life.

Tuscan soup with spicy sausages, potatoes, and spinach. I worked at OG for a long time and the kale is added when the pan is refilled and served immediately. The longer it sits, the more the kale softens up, but most. Soup was very good with a delicate flavor.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can cook tuscan soup using 12 ingredients and 14 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tuscan Soup:

1. Make ready 1 box mushrooms
1. Make ready 1 onion
1. Make ready 5 teeth of garlic
1. Get 1 leek
1. Make ready  Vegetable broth
1. Get 1 celery
1. Prepare 5 carrots
1. Prepare 5 potatoes
1. Prepare 1 box kale

So, &#34;zuppa&#34; means soup in Italian. &#34;Toscana&#34; refers to the Tuscany region of Italy. Therefore, &#34;Zuppa Toscana&#34; translates to &#34;Tuscan soup&#34; or &#34;Tuscan-style soup.&#34; Traditionally, this soup is made with lots of veggies, beans, potatoes, olive oil, spices, Italian bacon, and Tuscan bread (it kind of reminds me of a minestrone). Add thinly sliced potatoes (I use a mandoline) and the cooked sausage to the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in the heavy cream and let heat through.
