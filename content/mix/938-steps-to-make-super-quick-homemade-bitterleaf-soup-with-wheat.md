Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
