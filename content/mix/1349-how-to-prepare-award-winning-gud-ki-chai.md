Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
