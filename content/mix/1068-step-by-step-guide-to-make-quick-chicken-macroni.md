Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
