Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
