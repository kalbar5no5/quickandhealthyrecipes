Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
