Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
