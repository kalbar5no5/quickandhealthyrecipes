Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
