Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
