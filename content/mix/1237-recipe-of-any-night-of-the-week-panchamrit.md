Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
