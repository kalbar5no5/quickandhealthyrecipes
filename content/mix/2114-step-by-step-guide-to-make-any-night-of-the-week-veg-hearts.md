Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
