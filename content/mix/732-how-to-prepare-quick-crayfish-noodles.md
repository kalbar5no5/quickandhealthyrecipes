Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
