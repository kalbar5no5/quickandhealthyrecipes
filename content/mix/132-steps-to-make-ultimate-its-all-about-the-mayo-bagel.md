Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
