Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
