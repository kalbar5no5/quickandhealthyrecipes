- "In a large Dutch oven (or saute pan as was the case today), lay your chicken on a single layer if possible, skin side up, along with the rest of the ingredients *except.

- "Then flip the chicken skin side up again, turn the heat up to medium, and simmer, *un*covered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. This will reduce the sauce and intensify all the flavors.  If you have the time and energy, you might like to baste the skin from time to time with the sauce."

Chicken groundnut stew is, in various forms, common all over West Africa, and this is my version, inspired by my colleagues at UW.

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
