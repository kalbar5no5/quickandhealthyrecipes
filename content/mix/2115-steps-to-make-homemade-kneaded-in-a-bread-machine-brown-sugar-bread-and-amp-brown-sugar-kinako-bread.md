Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
