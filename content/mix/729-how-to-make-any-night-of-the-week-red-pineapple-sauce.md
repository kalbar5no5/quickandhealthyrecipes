Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
