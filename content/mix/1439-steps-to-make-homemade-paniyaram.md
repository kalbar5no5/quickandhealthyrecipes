Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
