Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
