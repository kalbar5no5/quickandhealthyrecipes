Hello everybody, it's Brad, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, marinated chikuwa. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

The marinade is a mix of olive oil, red wine vinegar, honey, garlic and a few dried spices. Combine it all, and that&#39;s it!

Marinated Chikuwa is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They are fine and they look wonderful. Marinated Chikuwa is something which I have loved my entire life.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
