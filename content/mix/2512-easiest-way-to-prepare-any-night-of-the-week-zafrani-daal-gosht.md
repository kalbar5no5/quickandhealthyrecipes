Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
