Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
