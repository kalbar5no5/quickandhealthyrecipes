recipeingredient:
- "500 grams Spring ginger root"
- "400 ml Vinegar"
- "160 grams Sugar"
- "2 tbsp Honey"
- "1 tsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the spring ginger roots, and slice very very thinly without peeling (I used a vegetable peeler to slice it thinly)."
- "The ginger roots are not peeled, but do cut off any browned or discolored bits. Don&#39;t cut the red shoot ends off. They will turn the ginger a pretty pink color."
- "Sprinkle the sliced ginger with a little salt (not listed), and mix up quickly. Leave it for a while."
- "Make the sweet vinegar sauce: Put the vinegar, sugar, honey and salt in a pan and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to low-medium, and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Pour into storage jars that have been sterilized in boiling water, and leave to cool."
- "Bring water to a boil in another pan, and add the sliced ginger from Step 2, salt and all. Boil for 3 minutes, then drain well. Put the ginger slices in the sweet vinegar sauce filled jars while still hot. (They will turn a pretty pink after some time.)"
- "You can start eating it the day it&#39;s made, but they will taste better after they have been marinating for 4 to 5 days when the flavors will have permeated the ginger, and the vinegar will have become mild. To store the ginger, close the lids tightly and refrigerator."
- "Serve with sushi."

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
