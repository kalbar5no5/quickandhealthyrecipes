Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
