Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
