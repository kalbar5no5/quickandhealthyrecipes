- "1 cup warm water"
- "2 tbsp maple syrup"
- "1 package active dry yeast 25 oz"
- "3 1/2 cup all purpose white flour"
- "1/4 cup plain greek yogurt"
- "2 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1 egg"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by activating the yeast. Briefly stir the warm water and maple syrup in a bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on top and give it a short stir. Cover the bowl for 10 minutes. After that, you should see that the yeast has created a foam."
- "Add all remaining ingredients and stir until a slightly sticky dough forms. If you want to add in mix ins, now is the time."
- "Remove the dough from the bowl. Grease the bowl using olive oil and put the dough back. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm spot. You want the dough to at least double in size which can take between 1-4 hours."
- "Turn the dough out onto a floured counter top and divide into 8 equal pieces."
- "Roll each piece out using a rolling pin. If you want something like a naan, roll the pieces to about 6 inches in diameter. If you want something closer to a flat bread, then aim for 8 inches. You should note that a naan will keep for a couple days where a flat bread typically is only good for the day you made it."
- "Set your air fryer to 380 F for 6 minutes. Brush each piece with olive oil and fry for 3 minutes before flipping over."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
