Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
