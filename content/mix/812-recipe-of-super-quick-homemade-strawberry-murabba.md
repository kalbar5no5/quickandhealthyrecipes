Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
