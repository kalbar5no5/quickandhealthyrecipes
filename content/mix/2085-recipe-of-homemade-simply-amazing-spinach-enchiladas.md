Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!
