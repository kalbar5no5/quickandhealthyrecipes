Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
