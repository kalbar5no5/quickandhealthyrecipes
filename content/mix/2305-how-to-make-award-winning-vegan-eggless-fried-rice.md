Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
