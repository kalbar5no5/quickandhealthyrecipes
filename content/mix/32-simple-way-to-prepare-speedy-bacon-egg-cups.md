Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
