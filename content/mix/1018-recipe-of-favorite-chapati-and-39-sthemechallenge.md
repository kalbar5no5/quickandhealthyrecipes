When the pan starts smoking, put a chapati on it. A chapati is a form of roti — or bread — and it is often referred to as such. Chapatis in particular, however, differ from other flat breads encompassed by the term roti in that they must only be made from whole wheat flour. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
