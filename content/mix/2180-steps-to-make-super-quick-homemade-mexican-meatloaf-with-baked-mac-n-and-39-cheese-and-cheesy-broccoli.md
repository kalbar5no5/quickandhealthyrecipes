Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
