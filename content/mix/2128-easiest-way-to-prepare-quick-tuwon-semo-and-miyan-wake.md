Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
