Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
