Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
