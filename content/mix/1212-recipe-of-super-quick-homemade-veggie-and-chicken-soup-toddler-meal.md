Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
