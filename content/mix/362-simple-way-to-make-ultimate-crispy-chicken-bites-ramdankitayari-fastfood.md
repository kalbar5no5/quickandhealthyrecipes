Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
