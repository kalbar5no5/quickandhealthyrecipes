Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
