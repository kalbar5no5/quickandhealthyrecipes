Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
