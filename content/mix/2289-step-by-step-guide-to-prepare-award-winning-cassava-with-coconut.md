Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
