Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
