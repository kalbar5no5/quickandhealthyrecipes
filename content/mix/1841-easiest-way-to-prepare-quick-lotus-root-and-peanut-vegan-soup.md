Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
