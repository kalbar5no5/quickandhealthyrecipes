Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
