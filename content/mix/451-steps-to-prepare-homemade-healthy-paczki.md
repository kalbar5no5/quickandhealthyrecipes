Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
