recipeingredient:
- "3 tbsp yeast"
- "2 1/2 tbsp honey or 3 tbs white sugar"
- "1 cup warm water"
- "3 eggs"
- "3/4 cup melted coconut oil or canola vegetable or olive oil"
- "5 cup warm water"
- "6 cup whole wheat flour"
- "2 tbsp salt"
- "6 cup white flour 6 cups"
- "1 cup shredded flax seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix yeast, honey and 1 cup warm water. Let stand for 10 minutes."
- "Add flax seeds, eggs, and oil and mix well."
- "Add 5 cups of warm water and whole wheat flour. Mix well."
- "Add salt and mix well."
- "Add white flour one cup at a time, mixing well each time. Add flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is soft and kneadable."
- "Take dough and divide into six equal sections. Form a loaf with each section."
- "Place loafs in oiled loaf pans and poke a few holes in a nice pattern with a knife (this allows the dough to rise without forming air pockets)."
- "Cover with clean towel and let rise until at least doubled their size in a warm place. (Letting them sit for 7-10 minutes in the oven on &#34;warm&#34; setting, covered with a towel, will help them rise better). After the 7-10 minutes take them out and let them rise on the counter until they are the appropriate size."
- "Bake at 350°F until golden brown."
- "I always mix and knead the dough in my Bosch machine and then bake in the oven. Much easier and yields much fluffier bread."
- "After the bread is baked, take them out of the pans immediately and let cool. Slice the bread. Place loafs in ziploc bags. Because this recipe yields 6 loafs, I usually freeze 5 and just take them out as needed, defrosting and storing them in the refrigerator. Pop them in the toaster and they still taste fresh as ever. :)"

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
