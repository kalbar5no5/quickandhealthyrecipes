Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
