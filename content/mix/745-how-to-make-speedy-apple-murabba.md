Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
