It&#39;s amazing how much of a role nostalgia plays with food, isn&#39;t it? Repeat the breading and frying process with the remaining hot dogs. Kelly&#39;s Notes: When dipping the hot dogs in the batter, it&#39;s easiest if you pour the batter into a tall glass. The corn-dog is simple but satisfying. I did not try the cole slaw due to a container failure (my fault). 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
