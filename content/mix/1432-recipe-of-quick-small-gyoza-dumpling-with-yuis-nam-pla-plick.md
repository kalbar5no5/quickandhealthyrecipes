How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
