Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
