Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
