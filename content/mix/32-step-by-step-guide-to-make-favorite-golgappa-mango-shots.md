Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
