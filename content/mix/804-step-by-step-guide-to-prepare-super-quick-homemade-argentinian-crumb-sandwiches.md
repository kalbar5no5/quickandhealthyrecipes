Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
