Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
