Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
