Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
