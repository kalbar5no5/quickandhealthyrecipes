Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
