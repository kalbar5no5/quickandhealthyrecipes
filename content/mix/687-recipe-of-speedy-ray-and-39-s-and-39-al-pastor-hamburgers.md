Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
