Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
