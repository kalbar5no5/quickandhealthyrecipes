This soup is still pretty good if you use just water and cook it with a ham bone or ham hock (or even some bacon grease, in a pinch), but the chicken stock makes it so. A fairly traditional navy bean and ham soup with instructions for making in an Instant Pot® cooker. I use a package of Hurst&#39;s® navy beans for this recipe but feel free to use any dry navy beans. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
