Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
