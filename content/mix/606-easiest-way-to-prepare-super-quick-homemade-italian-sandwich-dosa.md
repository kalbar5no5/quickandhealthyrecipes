How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
