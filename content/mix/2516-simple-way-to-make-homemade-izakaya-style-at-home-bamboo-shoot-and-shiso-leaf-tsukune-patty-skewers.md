Our traditional Japanese Kushiyaki grill uses Binchotan, a charcoal made from oak to grill individual skewers. On the eighth floor, you can find an English-friendly Izakaya specializing in Japanese food. Unlike many Izakaya, Den Rokuen-Tei has terrace seats, so you can take in the night-time views of Shibuya as you eat and drink. Typical izakaya dishes include chicken karaage (Japanese-style fried chicken), yakitori, edamame, grilled fish, french fries, sashimi, sushi, ebi-mayo (fried shrimp with mayo), nabe (Japanese hotpot) and salads. Izakaya are also typically attended by large groups of friends or colleagues and are rarely a dating spot. 

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
