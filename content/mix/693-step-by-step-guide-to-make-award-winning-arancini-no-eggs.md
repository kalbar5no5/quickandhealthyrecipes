The filling in this recipe is one of the most classic—a meat ragù , green peas, and melty mozzarella, but there are endless other types of fillings including.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
