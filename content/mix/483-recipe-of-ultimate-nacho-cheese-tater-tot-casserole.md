Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
