Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
