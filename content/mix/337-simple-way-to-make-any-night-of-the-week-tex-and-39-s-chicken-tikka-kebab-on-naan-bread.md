Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
