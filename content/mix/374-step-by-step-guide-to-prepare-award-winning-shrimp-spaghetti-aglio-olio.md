Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
