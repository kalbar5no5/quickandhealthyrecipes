Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
