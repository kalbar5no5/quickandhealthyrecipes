recipeinstructions:
- "In saucepan, heat pineapple juice, milk and butter.  Heat to warm, but not hot."
- "If using packet yeast, add to liquid mixture and let foam for 10 minutes before adding to dry ingredients."
- "In bread machine pan, add salt, sugar,  eggs, flour and yeast on top. Slowly add liquid."
- "Set machine to sweet bread setting and choose light, medium or dark crust setting. I like setting mine to light setting, but its personal preference."

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
