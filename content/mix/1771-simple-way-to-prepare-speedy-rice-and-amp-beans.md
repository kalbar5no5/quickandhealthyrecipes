Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
