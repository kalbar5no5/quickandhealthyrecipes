Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
