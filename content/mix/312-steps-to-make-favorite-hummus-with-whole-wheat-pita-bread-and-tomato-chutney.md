Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
