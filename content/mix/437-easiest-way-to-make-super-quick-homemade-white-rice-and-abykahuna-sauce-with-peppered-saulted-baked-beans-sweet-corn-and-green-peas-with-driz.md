Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
