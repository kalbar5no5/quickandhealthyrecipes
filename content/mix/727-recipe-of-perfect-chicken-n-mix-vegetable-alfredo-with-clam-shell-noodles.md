Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
