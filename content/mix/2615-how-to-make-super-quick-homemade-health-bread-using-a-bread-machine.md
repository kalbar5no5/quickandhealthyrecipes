Since I&#39;m using old bread machine set on medium crust-white bread, the first time I tried this, the bread fell. The bread machine is the perfect appliance for everyone else -- those who love the smell and taste of freshly baked bread and rolls, but don&#39;t have the need to knead. But if you&#39;re going to start your bread machine right away instead of using a timer, you can replace the water with milk or buttermilk.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
