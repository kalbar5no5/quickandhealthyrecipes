Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
