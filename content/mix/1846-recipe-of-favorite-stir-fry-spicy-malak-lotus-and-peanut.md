In general, stir-fry is healthy, since the speedy, high heat cooking doesn&#39;t require much oil or fat. Plus, most stir-fries rely on lean meat or proteins, like chicken, tofu or lean steak. To make it even healthier, use a whole grain or vegetable base rather than white rice. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
