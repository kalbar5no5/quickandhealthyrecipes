How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
