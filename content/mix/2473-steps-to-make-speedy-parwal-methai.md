Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
