Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
