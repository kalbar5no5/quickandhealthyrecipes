Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
