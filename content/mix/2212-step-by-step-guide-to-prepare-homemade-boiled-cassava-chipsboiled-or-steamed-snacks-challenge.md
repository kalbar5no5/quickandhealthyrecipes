Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
