Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
