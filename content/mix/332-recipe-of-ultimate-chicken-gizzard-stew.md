Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
