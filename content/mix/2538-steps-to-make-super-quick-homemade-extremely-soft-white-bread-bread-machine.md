Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
