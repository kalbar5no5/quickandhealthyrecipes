How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
