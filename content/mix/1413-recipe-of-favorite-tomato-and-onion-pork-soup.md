Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
