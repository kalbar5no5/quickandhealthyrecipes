Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
