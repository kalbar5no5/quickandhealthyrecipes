How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
