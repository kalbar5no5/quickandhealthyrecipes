Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
