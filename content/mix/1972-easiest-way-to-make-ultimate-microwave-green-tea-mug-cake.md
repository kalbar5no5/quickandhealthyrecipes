How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
