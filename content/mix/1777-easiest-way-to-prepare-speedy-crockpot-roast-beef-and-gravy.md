Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
