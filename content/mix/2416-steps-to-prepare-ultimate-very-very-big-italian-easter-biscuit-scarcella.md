Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
