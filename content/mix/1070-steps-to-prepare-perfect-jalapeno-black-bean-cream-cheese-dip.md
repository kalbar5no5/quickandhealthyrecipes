Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
