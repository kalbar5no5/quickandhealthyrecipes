Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
