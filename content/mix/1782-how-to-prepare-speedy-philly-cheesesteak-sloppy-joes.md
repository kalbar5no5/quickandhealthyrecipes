Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
