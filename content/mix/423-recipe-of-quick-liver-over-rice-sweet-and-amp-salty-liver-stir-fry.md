Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
