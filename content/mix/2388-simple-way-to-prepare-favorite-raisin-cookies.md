Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
