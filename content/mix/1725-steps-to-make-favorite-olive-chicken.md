Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
