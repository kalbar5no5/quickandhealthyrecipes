Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
