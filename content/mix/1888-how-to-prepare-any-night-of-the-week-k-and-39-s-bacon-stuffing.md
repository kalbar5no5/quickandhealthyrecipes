Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
