Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
