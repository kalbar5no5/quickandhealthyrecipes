Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
