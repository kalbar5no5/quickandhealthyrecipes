Fettuccine alfredo is one of life&#39;s greatest comfort foods. It&#39;s creamy, cheesy, carb-y, and super super flavorful. We especially love this version because the shrimp adds lots of extra flavor and some lean. While you make the shrimps, you can also boil the pasta according to your liking and reserve one cup of their water.

We especially love this version because the shrimp adds lots of extra flavor and some lean. While you make the shrimps, you can also boil the pasta according to your liking and reserve one cup of their water. This is my Roasted Red Pepper &amp; Shrimp Alfredo. The peppers pair nicely with the shrimp and the classic alfredo. The Alfredo can be used in the traditional fettuccine alfredo as well, that is why I put. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
