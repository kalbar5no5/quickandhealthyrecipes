recipeingredient:
- "2 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "2 1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce"
- "1 cup 1 milk can substitute soy or almond milk for dairy free option"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup unsweetened dried cranberries such as Ocean Spray Craisins"
- "1/2 cup fresh blueberries washed and gently dried may use frozen thaw first but fresh is best"
- " Optional topping"
- "2 tsp additional sugar"
- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- " nonfood"
- "12 paper muffin tin liners"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400°F and place one paper liner per well in a muffin tin."
- "In a medium bowl place the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Stir to combine."
- "Add applesauce, milk and vanilla. Stir until just incorporated."
- "Gently fold in cranberries and blueberries."
- "Fill paper lined muffin cups evenly until all batter is used, a little over 3/4 full each. Mix additional sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle on top of batter in each cup if desired."
- "Bake in pre-heated oven 20-25 minutes or until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Do not over-Bake or they will be dry."
- "Remove from oven. Let cool in muffin tin for 10 minutes. Remove muffins from tin and place on wire rack to cool completely. Eat and enjoy a &#34;better for you&#34; muffin!"
- "NOTE: If you would like to enjoy these warm you will have to spray your paper liners with cooking spray. Due to the lack of oil they tend to stick to the liners while still warm. They sometimes stick when cool as well, so spraying anyway may be desired. Although this does add a trivial amount of oil. They always come clean out of the paper on day two without spray, for some crazy reason. Lol. You can also spray your muffin tin directly instead of using paper liners."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better.

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood.

Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA.

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!
