recipeingredient:
- "2 lb Chicken Breast"
- "1 1/2 cup AP Flour"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 pinch crushed black pepper"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 1/2 cup Panko"
- "3 tbsp Olive Oil"
- "2 cup Tomato Sauce"
- " About 1 cup of cheese grated parmesan mozarella or both"
recipeinstructions:
- "You want to flatten out your chicken breast to start off. The traditional method seems to be to just pound it flat with a meat tenderizer or a heavy skillet. I like to butterfly my chicken cutlets though. If you don&#39;t plan on overcooking your chicken, it doesn&#39;t need to be pulverized, and it will stay nice and juicy. I lay the breast flat and slice into the mid-section through the thickest part, peeling it opened as I go, just like If you were planning to make stuffed chicken breast or cordon bleu."
- "Prepare your dredging platters. Lay out three shallow dishes. In one, add flour, salt, and pepper, and mix it up. In the next, crack 2 eggs, and whisk them up. In the third, spread out your panko. You can use regular breadcrumbs if you can&#39;t find panko, but I love panko."
- "Place a piece of chicken in the flour and make sure it is coated well. Dust it off just a bit and move it to the egg. Again, make sure it is coated well. Now, into the panko, turning and pressing down a couple of times, making sure that the whole piece of chicken is well coated. Repeat the process with your other chicken pieces. With 2 lbs of chicken breast, you&#39;ll probably get 2-3 big pieces."
- "Heat olive oil in a non-stick pan. You can cook these bad Larry&#39;s on medium-low. I like to cook them pretty slow to get a good golden crisp on both sides, and by this time the chicken should be cooked mostly through depending on how thick you left your cutlets."
- "Preheat your oven to 350F"
- "Warm your tomato sauce gently on the stove. I always make my own sauce. Check out my marinara recipe if you&#39;re interested, it&#39;s very simple."
- "When your chicken cutlets are golden, arrange them in a baking platter large enough to accommodate them without any overlap."
- "Spread some tomato sauce over the chicken cutlets."
- "Top with cheese."
- "Place in the oven for about 10 minutes. You just want the cheese to melt, and maybe, if your chicken was pretty thick, to finish cooking it through. If you&#39;re confident that your chicken is cooked through, I would recommend broiling instead, just to turn the cheese golden crusty brown. There&#39;s really no flavor like that caramel crusty cheese flavor."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
