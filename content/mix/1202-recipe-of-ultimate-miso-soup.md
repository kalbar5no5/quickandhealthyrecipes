Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
