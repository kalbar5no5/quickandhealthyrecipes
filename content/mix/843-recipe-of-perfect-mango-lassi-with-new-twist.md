Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!
