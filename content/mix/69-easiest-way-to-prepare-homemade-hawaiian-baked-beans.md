Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
