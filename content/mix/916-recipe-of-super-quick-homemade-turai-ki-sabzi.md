A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body.
