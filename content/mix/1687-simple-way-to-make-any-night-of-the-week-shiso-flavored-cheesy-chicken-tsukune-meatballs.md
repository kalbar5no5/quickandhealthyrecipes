Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
