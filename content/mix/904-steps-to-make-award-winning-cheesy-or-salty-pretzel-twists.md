Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
