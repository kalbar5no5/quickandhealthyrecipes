Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
