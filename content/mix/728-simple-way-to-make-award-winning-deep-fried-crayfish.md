Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
