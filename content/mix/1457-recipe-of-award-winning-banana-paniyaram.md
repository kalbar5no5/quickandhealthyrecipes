Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
