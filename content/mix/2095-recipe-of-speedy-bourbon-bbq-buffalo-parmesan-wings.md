Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
