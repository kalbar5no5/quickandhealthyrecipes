Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
