Deer can be seen in many parts of Texas. Chile con carne is the official dish of Texas, so it&#39;s no surprise that deer meat would be added to chili. Brown the venison in a stock pot (I use non-stick). I serve mine with a little sour cream and diced onion on top, and some crusty bread. However, venison is a very lean meat and if you are subbing for ground beef or another meat with a high-fat content you may want to add a little bit of oil to your pan to help add needed fat to the dish. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
