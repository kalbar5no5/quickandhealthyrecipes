It tastes so delicious and you. It&#39;s so damn hearty and filling and most importantly, it reminds me of my Grandma.

So, I created this healthier version of my Grandma&#39;s brown bread recipe.

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
