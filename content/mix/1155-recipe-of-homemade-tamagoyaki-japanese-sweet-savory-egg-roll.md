Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
