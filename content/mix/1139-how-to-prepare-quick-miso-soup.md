Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
