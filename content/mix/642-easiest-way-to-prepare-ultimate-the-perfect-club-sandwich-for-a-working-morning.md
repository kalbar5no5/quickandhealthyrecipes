Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
