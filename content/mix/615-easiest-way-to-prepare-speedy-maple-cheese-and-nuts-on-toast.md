Remove from the oven and with a spoon, give the nuts a gentle stir to evenly coat the nuts with the syrup then allow to completely cool. Once they&#39;re toasted, remove them from the baking sheet to a bowl to cool. Lift the parchment paper, with all the toasted nuts, off the baking sheet to cool. Then store in an airtight container until ready to use. It&#39;s best to toast nuts whole, then to chop them if you need smaller pieces. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
