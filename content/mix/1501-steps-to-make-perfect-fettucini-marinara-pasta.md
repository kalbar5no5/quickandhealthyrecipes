Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
