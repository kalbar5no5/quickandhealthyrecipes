Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
