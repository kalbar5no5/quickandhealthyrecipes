Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
