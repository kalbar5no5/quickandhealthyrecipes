Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
