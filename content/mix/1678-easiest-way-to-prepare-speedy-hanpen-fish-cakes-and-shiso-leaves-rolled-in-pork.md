Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
