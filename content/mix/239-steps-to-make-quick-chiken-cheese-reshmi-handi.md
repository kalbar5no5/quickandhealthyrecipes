Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
