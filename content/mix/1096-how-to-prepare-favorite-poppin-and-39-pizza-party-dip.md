Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
