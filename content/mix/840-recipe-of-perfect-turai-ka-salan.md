Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
