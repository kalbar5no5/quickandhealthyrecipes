Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
