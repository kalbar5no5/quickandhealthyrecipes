Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
