Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
