Season with chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and sugar.

Season with chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and sugar. Cincinnati-Style Chili: Prepare as above, except omit green sweet pepper. And, this is the only chili I will make from now on when a chili con carne sauce is needed for enchiladas or hot dogs. I have a recipe for &#39;all day&#39; chili that simmers on the stove and uses chuck roast. Cover tightly with heavy-duty plastic wrap, and fold back a corner to allow steam to escape. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
