Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
