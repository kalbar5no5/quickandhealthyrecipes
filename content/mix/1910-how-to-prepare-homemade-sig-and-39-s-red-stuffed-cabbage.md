Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
