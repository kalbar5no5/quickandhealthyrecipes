How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
