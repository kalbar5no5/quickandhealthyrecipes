Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
