Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
