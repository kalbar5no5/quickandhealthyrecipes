Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
