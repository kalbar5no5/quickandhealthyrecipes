Inarizushi is a very casual food and a perfect lunch for picnics because it&#39;s best eaten right from your hands. Aburaage is tofu skin that is deep fried, and used in many forms in Japanese cuisine. It has a slightly spongy texture. Because it&#39;s deep fried, it can be pretty greasy, so it&#39;s often prepared boiled in hot water first. Tsukudani kombu (a type of seaweed) is a popular addition to rice dishes and salads in Japan, and can be used in inarizushi. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
