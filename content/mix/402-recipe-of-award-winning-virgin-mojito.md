Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
