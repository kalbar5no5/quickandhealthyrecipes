Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
