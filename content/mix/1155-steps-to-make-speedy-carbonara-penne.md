Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
