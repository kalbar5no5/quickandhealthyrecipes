How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
