How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
