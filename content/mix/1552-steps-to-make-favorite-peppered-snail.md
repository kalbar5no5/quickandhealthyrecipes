Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
