Local, family-owned Canberra business, bringing you our family&#39;s secret fried chicken recipe served up in our signature fricken burgers and boxes. Started in a food truck, now bringing our goods to you from Canberra&#39;s food capital - Lonsdale St, Braddon. I searched all over for great fried chicken recipes, and ultimately used a lot of ideas combined into this &#34;ultimate&#34; recipe. The baking powder in the coating makes this especially crisp! I like using chicken thigh fillets rather than breasts - they&#39;re much more flavorful, and higher in iron, too. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
