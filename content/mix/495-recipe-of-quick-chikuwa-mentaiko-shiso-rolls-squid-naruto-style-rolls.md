Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
