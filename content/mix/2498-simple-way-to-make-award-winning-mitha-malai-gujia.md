Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
