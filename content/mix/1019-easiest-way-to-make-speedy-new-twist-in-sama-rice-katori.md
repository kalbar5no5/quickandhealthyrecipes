How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
