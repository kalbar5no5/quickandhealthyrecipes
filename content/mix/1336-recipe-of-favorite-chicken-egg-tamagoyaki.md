Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
