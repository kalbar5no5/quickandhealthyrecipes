Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
