Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
