Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
