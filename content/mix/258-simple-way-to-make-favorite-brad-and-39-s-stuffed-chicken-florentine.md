Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
