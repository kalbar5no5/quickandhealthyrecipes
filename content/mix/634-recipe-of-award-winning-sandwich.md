Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
