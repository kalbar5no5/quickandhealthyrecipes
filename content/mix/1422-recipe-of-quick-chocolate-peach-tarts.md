Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
