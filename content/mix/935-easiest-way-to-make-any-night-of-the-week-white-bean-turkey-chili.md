Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
