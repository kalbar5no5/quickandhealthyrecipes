Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
