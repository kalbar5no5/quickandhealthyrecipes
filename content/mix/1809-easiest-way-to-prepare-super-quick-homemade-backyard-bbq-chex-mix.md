Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
