Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
