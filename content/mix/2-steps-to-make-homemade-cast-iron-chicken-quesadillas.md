Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
