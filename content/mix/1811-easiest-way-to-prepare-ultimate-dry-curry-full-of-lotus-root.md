Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
