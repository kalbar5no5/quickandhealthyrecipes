Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
