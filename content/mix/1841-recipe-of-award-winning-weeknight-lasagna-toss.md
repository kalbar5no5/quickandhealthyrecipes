Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
