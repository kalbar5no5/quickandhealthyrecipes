Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
