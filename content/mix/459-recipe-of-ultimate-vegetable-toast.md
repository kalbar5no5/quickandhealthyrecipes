Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
