Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
