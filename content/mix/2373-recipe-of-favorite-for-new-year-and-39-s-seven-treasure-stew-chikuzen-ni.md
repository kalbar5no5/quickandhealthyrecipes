Both must be cooked on New Year&#39;s Eve, however. 

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
