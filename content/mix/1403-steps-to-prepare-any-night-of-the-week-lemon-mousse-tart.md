Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
