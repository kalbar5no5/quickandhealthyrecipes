Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
