Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
