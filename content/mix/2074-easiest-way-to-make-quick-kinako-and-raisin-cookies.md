Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
