Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
