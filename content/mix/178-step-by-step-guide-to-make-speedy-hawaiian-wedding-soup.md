Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
