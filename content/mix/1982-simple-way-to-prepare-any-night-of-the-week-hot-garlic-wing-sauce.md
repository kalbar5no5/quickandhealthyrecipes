Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
