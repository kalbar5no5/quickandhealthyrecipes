Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.
