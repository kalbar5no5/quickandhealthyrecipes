Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
