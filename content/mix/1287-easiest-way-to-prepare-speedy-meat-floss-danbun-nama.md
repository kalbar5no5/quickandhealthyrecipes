Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
