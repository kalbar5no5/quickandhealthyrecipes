Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
