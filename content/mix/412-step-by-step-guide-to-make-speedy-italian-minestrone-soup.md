Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
