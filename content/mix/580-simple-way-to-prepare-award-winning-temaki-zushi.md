Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
