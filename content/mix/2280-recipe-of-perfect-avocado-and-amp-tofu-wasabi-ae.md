Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
