How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
