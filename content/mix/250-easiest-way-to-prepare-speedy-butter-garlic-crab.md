Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
