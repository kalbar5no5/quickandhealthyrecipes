Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
