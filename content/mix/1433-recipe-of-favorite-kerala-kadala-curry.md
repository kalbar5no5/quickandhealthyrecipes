Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
