Perhaps a little bit retro, this one-dish chicken macaroni casserole is pure comfort food in a pan. Chicken and pasta combine with peas and pimentos in a simple sauce made with cream of chicken soup and milk. The pimientos add some color and depth of flavor to the sauce mixture, and a buttery crumb crust finishes this casserole perfectly. Add onion to pasta and stir to combine.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
