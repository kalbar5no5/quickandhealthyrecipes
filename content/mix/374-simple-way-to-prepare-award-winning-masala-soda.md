Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
