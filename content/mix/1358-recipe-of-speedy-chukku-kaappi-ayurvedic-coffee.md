Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
