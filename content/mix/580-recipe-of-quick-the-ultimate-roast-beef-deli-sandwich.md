Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
