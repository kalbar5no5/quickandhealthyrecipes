Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
