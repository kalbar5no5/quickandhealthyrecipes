Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
