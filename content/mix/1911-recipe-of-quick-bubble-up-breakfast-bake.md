Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
