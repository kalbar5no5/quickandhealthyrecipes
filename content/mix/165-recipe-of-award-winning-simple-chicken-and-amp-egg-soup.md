Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
