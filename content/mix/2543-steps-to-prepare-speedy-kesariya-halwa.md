Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
