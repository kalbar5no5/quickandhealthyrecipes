Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
