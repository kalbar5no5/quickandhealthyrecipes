Seriously, the hardest part is trying to refrain from opening the oven to take a peek!

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
