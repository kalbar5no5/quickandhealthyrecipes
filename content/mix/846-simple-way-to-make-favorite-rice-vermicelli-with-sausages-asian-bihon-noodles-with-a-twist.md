Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
