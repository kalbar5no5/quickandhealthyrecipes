Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
