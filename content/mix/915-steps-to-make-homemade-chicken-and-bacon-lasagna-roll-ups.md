Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!
