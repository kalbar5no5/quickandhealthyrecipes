- "Heat oil to 170°C to 180°C. The right temperature can be tested by dropping a little bit of batter into the oil. If the batter sinks a little into the oil, then comes back the surface, the temperature is right for frying. *See my &#39;Tempura Batter&#39; recipe https://cookpad.com/uk/recipes/1471911-tempura-batter"
- "Dip the pieces into Tempura Batter and slide them into the oil. Do not fry too many at once."
- "When the pieces are small such as beans, carrot or onion, fry the pieces in small bunches."
- "Turn them over a few times. When they are cooked and the batter is light golden and crispy, take them out and lay them on a rack to drain the oil."
- "Place a sheet of paper on a plate and arrange the Tempura so it presents well. The paper helps soak up any excess oil and makes the dish look nice."
- "Serve with Tentsuyu (dipping sauce). *It is often served with grated Daikon radish and grated Ginger to add extra flavour to the Tentsuyu dipping sauce. Sometimes Tempura are served with salt. My grandfather used to love sweet potato Tempura with BBQ sauce…"

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
