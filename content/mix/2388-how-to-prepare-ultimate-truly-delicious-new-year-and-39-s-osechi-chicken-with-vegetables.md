Osechi are easily recognizable by their special boxes called jūbako (重箱), which resemble bentō boxes. Like bentō boxes, jūbako are often kept stacked before and after use.

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
