Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
