Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
