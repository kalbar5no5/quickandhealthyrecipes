Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
