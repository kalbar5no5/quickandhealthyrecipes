Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
