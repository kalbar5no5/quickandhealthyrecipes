Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
