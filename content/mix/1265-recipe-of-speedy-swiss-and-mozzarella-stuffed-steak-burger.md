Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
