Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
