I really enjoy making dinners in the CrockPot all year long, but especially in the cold, winter months. My Slow Cooker Beef Stew is rich and hearty, packed with chunks of diced beef, carrots and potatoes. All cooked in a thick sauce. The key to getting a thick sauce in the slow cooker is to firstly coat the meat in flour and then brown on the hob. OMG OMG OMG this is the best slow cooker beef stew recipe ever, we all thoroughly enjoyed it and the spices made it taste so lovely, I cook this at least once a week now, absolutely beautiful, thank you so much, AAA+RATED. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
