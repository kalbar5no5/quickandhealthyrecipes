Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
