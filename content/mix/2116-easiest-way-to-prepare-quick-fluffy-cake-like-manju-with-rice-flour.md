Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
