Tofu, we realized, could do the same thing mozzarella does in a traditional caprese salad: moderate the acidity of the tomatoes, lend the dish some creaminess, and make it more substantial. Shiso and basil are like long-lost cousins: they have totally different flavors, though they share a sort of mintiness. Shiso comes in green or purple leaves with a slightly prickly texture and pointy, jagged edges, and it has a unique and vibrant taste that I could describe as herbaceous and citrusy. Like most leafy herbs, I find it is best used raw, the leaves whole or chiffonaded.

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
