Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
