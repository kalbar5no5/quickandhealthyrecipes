Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
