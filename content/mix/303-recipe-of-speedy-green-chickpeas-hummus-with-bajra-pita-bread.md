Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
