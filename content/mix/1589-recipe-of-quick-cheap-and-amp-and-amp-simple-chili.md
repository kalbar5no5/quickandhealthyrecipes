Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
