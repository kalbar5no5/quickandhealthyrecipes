Salisbury steak is a classic American dish with ground beef patties seasoned in various manors and served with brown gravy over mashed potatoes or noodles. Comfort food from out of the past. This is another request by my wife, but this time, she even remembered the recipe she made, but details like exact measurements were missing. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
