Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
