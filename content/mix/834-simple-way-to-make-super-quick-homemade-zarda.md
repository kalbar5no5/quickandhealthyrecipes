Zarda Bar-B-Q has &#34;the best barbecue ribs, brisket and turkey in Kansas City,&#34; says one BBQ customer on Yelp. Another raves, &#34;The most tender burnt ends I&#39;ve had in KC so far.&#34; And, &#34;Delicious thick fries, yummy crispy fried pickles, and the meat is always so tender.&#34; A customer on Urban Spoon writes, &#34;Zarda has this amazing. Zarda (Hindi: ज़र्दा, Urdu: زردہ ‎, Bengali: জর্দা) is a traditional boiled sweet rice dish, native to the Indian subcontinent, with (orange) food coloring, milk and sugar, and flavoured with cardamoms, raisins, saffron, pistachios or almonds. Zarda, commonly known as Power Princess, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Zarda is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It's appreciated by millions daily. They're fine and they look wonderful. Zarda is something that I've loved my entire life.

Zarda is a traditional sweet rice dessert originated from the Mughals. The name Zarda is derived from the Persian and Urdu term &#39;Zard&#39; meaning yellow. The dish gets its name as it is prepared using yellow color. (Source:wiki) Zarda also known as meethe chawal is usually prepared during special occasions like weddings, festivals and celebrations. Zarda is best served warm and I love it with a very strong cup of unsweetened tea after dinner.

The dish gets its name as it is prepared using yellow color. (Source:wiki) Zarda also known as meethe chawal is usually prepared during special occasions like weddings, festivals and celebrations. Zarda is best served warm and I love it with a very strong cup of unsweetened tea after dinner. The recipe I&#39;ve seen the women in my family use is very long and complicated, some involving boiling the rice separately and making a &#39; chashni &#39;, a sugar syrup infused with the cardamom and food colouring to pour over the plain rice seperately. Zarda is the Zimbabwe representative of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease International. Zarda is dedicated to improving the quality of life of people with dementia and those affected by it. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
