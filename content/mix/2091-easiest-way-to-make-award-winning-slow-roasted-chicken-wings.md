- " Lemon Pepper"
- " Onion Powder"
- " Garlic Powder"
- " Cooking spray"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 325°F.  For easy clean-up, line a cookie sheet with foil.  Use a slotted rack (I use a regular cooling rack) and cover with foil.  Punch a few holes in it to allow grease to drip onto the sheet pan.  Spray with cooking spray."
- "If wings are thawed, rinse and pat dry.  I usually put them in a zip lock bag - less dishes and clean up.  Pour some EVOO in the bag and add the wings.  Season to taste.  I use the above ingredients.  Use whatever suits you."
- "Bake at 325 for 1 hour.   Turn and bake another hour or until a meat thermometer reads 180.  If you like them a little more crispy, put them under the broiler for a few mins. - not long as they will dry out."
- "TIPS: If you are in a hurry, turn the heat up and cook them for less time. I was never a wings eater, until a friend told me about these. They are moist and fall off the bone. I like mine dry and dip in sauce when done. You can roast these, toss in your choice of sauce and stick back in the oven to heat. May take 2 hours, but well worth it."

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
