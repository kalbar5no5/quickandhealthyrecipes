Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
