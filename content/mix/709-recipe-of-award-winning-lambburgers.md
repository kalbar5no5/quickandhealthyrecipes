Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
