Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
