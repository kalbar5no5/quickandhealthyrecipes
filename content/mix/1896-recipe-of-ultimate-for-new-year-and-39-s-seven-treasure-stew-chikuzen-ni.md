A classic titan of the Chinese New Year table is fish of some kind. The fish must be whole and there must be two-one for Chinese New Year&#39;s Eve and one saved for Chinese New Year&#39;s Day. Both must be cooked on New Year&#39;s Eve, however. 

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
