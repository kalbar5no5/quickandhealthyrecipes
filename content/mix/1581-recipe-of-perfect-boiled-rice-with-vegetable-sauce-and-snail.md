How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
