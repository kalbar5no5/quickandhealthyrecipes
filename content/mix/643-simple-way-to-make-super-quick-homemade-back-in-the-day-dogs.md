Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
