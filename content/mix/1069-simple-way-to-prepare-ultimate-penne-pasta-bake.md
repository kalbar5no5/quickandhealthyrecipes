Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
