Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
