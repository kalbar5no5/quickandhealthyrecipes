How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
