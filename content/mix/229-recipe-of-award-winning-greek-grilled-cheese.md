Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
