recipeinstructions:
- "In a large frying pan cook onion and garlic until soft. Add mince to pan and cook until brown"
- "Add bolognaise sauce and tomato soup to pan. The tomato soup gives a great flavour. Simmer gently"
- "Add vegetables. I have a food processor and blitz zucchini, carrot, broccoli and cauliflower until they&#39;re extremely fine and can be hidden in the sauce so the kids don&#39;t notice"
- "While the meat sauce is simmering, place butter in large pot over cook top until almost melted and add corn flour, stirring with a whisk for approximately 1 min until you get a nice yellow roux"
- "Add the milk, 1 cup at a time, whisking in between to rid any lumps. Add in cream, cheese sauce, vegeta, salt and pepper to taste. Keep this simmering for 5 or so mins until it thickens. Stir through cheese until melted"

- "Sprinkle extra cheese on top and cook, covered with aluminium foil in an oven preheated to 200°C for half hour. Remove foil and cook for a further 15 mins until the lasagne is bubbling and golden brown on top. Remove from oven and allow to rest for 5 mins before serving"
- "This recipe makes 2 large lasagnas so halve if you only want one. I slice and freeze one up for lazy nights and freeze the left over meat sauce in batches for when I make spaghetti bolognaise or as a base for sloppy Joe&#39;s etc so it&#39;s economical"

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
