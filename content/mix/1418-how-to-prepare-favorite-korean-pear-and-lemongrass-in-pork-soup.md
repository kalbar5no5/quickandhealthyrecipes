Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!
