Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
