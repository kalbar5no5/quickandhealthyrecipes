Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
