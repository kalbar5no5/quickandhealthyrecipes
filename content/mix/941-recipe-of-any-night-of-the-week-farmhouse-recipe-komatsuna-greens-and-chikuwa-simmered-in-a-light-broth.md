Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
