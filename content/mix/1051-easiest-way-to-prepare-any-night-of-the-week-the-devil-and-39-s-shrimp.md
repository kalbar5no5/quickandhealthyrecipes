Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
