Weigh the loaf ingredients into the bread machine baking pan in the order listed. Replace pan into bread machine and select a program suitable for a white fruit/raisin bread. At the beep, (usually about five minutes before the end of the final kneading,) add the sultanas/ginger. Weigh the main ingredients into the bread machine and select Raisin or Speciality Bread and preferred Crust type At the beep, if you trust your machine not to mash up the fruit like mine always does, add the sultanas with just an incredibly light dusting of cardamom (or omit it if you don&#39;t like cardamom).

I hate eating over ripe bananas but they are the perfect ingredient for moist cakes and muffins.

All longtime bread machine users are familiar with the annoying little hole the kneading paddle leaves in the loaf once the paddle is dug out of the baked bread. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
