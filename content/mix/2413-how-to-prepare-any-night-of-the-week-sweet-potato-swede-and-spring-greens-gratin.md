Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
