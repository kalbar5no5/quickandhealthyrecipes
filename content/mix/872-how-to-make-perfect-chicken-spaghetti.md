How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
