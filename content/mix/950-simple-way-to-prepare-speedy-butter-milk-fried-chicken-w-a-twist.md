Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
