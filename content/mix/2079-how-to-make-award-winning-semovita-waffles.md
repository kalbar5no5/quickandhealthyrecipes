Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
