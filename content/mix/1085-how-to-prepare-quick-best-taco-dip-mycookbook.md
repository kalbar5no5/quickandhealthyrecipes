Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
