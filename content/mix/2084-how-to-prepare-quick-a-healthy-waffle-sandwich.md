How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
