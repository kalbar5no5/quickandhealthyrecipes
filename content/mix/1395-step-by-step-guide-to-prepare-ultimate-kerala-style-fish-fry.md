Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
