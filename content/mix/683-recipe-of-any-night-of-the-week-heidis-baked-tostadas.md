Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
