Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
