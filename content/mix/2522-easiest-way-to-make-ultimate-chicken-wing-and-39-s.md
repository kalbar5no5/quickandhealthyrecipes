Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
