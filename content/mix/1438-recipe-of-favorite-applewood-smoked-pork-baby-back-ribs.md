Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
