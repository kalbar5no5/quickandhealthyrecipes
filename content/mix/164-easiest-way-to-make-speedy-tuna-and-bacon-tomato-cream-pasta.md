Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
