Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
