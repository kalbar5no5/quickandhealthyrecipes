Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
