Stuffed Grape Leaves (Greek Dolmades) are often served as part of a meze (appetizer) plate. Too often they come from a can and are not fresh. These Vegetarian Stuffed Grape Leaves are a Mediterranean classic recipe made with short grain rice, parsley, tomatoes and onions - my favorite appetizer! The use of grape leaves to wrap food dates back to the days of Alexander the Great. While Americans tend to think of stuffed grape leaves as a Greek delicacy, dolmadaki may have originated. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
