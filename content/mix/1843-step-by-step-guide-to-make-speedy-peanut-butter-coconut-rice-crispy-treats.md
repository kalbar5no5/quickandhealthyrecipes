Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
