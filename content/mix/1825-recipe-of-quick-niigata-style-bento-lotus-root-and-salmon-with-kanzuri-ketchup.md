How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
