Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
