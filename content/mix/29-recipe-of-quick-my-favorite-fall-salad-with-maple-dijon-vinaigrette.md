Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
