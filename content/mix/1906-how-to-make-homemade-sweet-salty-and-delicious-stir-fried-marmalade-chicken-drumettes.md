How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
