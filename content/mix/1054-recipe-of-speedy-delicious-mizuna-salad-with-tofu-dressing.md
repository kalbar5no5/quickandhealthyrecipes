Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
