Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
