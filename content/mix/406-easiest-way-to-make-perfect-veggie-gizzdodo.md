Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
