Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
