Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
