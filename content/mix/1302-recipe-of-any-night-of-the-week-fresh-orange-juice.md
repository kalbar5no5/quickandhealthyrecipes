Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
