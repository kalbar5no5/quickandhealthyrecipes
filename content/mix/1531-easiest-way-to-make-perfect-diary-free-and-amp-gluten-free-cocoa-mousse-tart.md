Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
