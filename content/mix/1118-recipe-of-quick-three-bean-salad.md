Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
