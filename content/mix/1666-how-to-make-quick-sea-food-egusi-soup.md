How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
