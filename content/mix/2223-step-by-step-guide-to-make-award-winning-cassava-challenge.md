Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
