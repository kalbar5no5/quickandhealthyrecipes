Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
