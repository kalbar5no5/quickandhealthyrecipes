Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
