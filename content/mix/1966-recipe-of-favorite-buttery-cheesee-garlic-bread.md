Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
