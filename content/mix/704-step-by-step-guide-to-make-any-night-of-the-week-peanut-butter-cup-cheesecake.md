How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
