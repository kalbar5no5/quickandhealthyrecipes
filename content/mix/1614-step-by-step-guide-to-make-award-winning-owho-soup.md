Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
