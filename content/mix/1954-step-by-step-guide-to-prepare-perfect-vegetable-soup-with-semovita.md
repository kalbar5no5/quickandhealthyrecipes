Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!
