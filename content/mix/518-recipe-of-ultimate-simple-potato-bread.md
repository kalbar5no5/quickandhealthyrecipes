Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
