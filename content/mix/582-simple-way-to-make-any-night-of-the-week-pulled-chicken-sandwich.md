Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
