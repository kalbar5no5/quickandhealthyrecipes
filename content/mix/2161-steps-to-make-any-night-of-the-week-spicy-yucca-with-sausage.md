Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!
