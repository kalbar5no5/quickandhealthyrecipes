Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
