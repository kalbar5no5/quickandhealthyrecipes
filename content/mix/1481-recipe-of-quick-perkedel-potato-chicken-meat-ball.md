Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
