Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
