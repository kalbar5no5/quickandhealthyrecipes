Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
