Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
