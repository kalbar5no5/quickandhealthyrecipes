Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
