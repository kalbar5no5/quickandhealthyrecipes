Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
