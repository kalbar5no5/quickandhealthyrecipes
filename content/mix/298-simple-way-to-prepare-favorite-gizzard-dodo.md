Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
