Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!
