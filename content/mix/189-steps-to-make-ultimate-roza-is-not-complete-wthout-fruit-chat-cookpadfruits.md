Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
