The grocery store by my house (Harmons) has an impossibly good bakery, but I am saddened every time I walk through and see their otherwise stellar sugar cookies with their useless little swipe of frosting as thin as a human hair. I will sometimes even fold mini chocolate chips into this one. Product Title Fox Run Rosette &amp; Timbale Set Scandinavian Cookies B.

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
