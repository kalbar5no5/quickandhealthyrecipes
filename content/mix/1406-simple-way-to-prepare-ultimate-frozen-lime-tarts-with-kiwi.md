Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
