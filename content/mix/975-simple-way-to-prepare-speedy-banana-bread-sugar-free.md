Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
