Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
