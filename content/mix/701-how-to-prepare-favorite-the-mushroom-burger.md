Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
