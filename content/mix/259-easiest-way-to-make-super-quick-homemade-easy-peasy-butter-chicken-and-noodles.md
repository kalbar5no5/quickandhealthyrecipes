Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
