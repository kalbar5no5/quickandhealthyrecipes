Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
