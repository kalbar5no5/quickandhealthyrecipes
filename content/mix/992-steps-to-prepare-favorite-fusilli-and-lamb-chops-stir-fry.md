Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
