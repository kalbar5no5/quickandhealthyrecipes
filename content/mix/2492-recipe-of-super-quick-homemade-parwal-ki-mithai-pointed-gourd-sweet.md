Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
