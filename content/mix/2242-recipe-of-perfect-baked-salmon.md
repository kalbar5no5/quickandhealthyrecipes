Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
