Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
