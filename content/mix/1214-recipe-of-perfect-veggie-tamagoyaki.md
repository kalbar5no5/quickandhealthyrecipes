Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on.

The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body.
