Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
