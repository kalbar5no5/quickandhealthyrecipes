Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
