Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
