Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
