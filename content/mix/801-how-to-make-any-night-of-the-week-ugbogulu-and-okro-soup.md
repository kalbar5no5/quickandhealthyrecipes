Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
