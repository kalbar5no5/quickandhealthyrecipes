Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
