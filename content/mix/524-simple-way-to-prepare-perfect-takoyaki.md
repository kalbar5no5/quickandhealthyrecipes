It is great as a quick lunch or even an appetizer for dinner. Go ahead and try making this takoyaki recipe - it also tastes amazing with some cheese added in as well! Tako means octopus and yaki means grill or fry (as explained in these Japanese food terms), though, it is not just grilled octopus. They are round in shape and made from a batter of flour, egg and dashi stock with octopus and other ingredients as fillings. They are also round because they are cooked in a special pan. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
