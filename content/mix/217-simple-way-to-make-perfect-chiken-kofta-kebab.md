Chicken kabobs are seasoned differently than kofta and are typically threaded on a skewer. This is a light recipe that is awesome on the taste buds. It is very easy and quick to make and goes nicely along with couscous. You can play around with the vegetable ingredients till you get the right mixture, so those are estimates. I usually get a stir fry mix with peppers and onion. 

Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
