Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
