Salmoriglio (sammurigghiu in Sicilian) is a typical Sicilian sauce poured over grilled seafood (and sometimes with meat too). The best fish for the salmoriglio is sword fish.

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
