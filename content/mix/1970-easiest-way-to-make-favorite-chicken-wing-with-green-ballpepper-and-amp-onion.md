Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
