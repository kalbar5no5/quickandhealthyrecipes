Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
