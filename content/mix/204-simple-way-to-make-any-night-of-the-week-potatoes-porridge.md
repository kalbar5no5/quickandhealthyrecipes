How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
