Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
