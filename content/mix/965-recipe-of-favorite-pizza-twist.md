Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
