Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
