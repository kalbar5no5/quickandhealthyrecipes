How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
