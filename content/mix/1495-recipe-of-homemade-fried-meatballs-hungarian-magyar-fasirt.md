Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
