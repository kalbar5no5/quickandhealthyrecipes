I have shared that traditional hyderabadi biryani here. The recipe shared here in this post details a short cut method to make a simple one pot delicious chicken biryani in a pressure cooker or a pot. Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. 

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
