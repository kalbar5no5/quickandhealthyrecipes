##### The ingredients needed to make Macrobiotic Oden Made Simple with a Rice Cooker:

1. Get 1/3 Daikon radish
1. Take 2 large Potatoes
1. Take 4 Kombu (tied and soaked in water to extract the dashi stock)
1. Prepare 1 packet Shirataki noodles
1. Make ready 1/2 Carrot
1. Take 5 cm Lotus root
1. Make ready 1 Burdock root
1. Make ready 1 as much (to taste) Oden ingredients such as aburaage
1. Take 2 tbsp Soy sauce
1. Prepare 1 tsp Rice malt (or whatever sugar variety)
1. Get 1 tsp Kombu tea (if available)
1. Make ready 1/2 tsp Salt
1. Prepare 300 ml Water (preferably use the broth from the tied kombu)


The oden ingredients are simmered in the pot for hours, or even days, and when you bite into the ingredients your mouth will be filled with the juicy flavorful soup. If you prepare rice to serve with Oden, preserve the white water from cleaning rice. Put daikon and the white water in a small pot and start cooking until a skewer goes through (do not cover the lid). In Japan, we say the rice water will get rid of bitterness and bad smell from daikon and the water also makes daikon beautiful white color.

Put daikon and the white water in a small pot and start cooking until a skewer goes through (do not cover the lid). In Japan, we say the rice water will get rid of bitterness and bad smell from daikon and the water also makes daikon beautiful white color. Oden is conceptually very simple but given the huge variety of ingredients you can use, no one pot of Oden is the same. Although some items are almost de rigueur (Oden just isn&#39;t complete without boiled egg and daikon IMHO) others may simply be personal favourites or regional specialties. In a separate bowl mix the rice syrup, barley malt, and maple syrup together. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
