Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
