Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
