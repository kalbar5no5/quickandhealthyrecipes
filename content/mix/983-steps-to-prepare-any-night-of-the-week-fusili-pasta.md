Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
