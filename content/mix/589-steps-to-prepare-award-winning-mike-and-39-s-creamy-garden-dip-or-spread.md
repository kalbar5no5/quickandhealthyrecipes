Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
