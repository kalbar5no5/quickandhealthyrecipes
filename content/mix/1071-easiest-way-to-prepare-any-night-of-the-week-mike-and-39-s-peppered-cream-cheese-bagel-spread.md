Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
