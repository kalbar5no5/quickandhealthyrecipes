Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
