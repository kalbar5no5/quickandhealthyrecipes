Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
