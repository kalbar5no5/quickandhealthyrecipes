Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
