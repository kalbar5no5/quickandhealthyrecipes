Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
