Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
