Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
