Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
