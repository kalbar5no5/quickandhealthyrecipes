My neighbor loves this for the sauce (hubby gets the crabs), she likes to use it with chicken, fish or beef (dices the meat and simmers in the sauce till cooked and serves over rice with vegetables). I serve it with rice to pour the sauce over and some vegetables to make a complete meal. Our Chili Crab (which is commonly sold all over singapore)is much more complicated so this recipe is much more suitable to cook at home. I love this recipe and will cook it again but cannot agree that it taste like our local dish.

Our Chili Crab (which is commonly sold all over singapore)is much more complicated so this recipe is much more suitable to cook at home. I love this recipe and will cook it again but cannot agree that it taste like our local dish. The crab is extremely fresh, the flesh plump and succulent. The chilli crab gravy is a good balance of sweet, savoury and spicy. Some chilli crab gravy will make you wonder just where has the chilli gone, but not this. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
