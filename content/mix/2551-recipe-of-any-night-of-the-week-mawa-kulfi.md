Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
