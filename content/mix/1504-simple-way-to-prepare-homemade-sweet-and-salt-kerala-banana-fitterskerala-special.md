Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!
