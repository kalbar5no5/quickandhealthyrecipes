How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
