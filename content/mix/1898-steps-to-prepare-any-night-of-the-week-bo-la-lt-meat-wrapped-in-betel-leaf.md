Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
