Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
