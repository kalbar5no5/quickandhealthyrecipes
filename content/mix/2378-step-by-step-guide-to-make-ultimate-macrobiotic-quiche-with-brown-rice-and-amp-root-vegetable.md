How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
