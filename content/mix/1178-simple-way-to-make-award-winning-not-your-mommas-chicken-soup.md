I had a particularly rough cold over the holidays this past year, and I was desperately searching for the best method to relieve my symptoms. In a large pot, over medium heat, combine water, chicken, salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley, onion powder and bouillon cubes. This new twist on an old goody is sure to tantalize your taste buds. I usually freeze half for quick easy meals later.

This new twist on an old goody is sure to tantalize your taste buds. I usually freeze half for quick easy meals later. Start the chicken in your slow cooker with water as high as your cooker permits, add about ¼ of your onion, garlic clove, chili powder, black pepper and a small amount of salt. Take out your favorite soup pot and add a little olive oil in there. Next saute your garlic, chopped carrots, celery, and onions until almost tender. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
