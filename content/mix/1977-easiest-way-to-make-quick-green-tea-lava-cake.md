Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
