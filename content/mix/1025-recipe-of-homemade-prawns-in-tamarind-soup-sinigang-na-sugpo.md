Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
