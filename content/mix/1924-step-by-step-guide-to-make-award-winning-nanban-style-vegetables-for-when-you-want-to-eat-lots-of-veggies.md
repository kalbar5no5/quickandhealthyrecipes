Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
