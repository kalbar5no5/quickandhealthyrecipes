Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!
