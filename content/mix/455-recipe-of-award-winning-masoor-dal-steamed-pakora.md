Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
