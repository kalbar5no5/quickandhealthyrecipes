Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
