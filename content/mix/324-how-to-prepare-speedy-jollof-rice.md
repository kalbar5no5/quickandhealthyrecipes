If it is not dry at this point, then switch the heat to low to allow it to dry the excess water without making the rice much softer.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
