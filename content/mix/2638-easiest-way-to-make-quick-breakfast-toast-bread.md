Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
