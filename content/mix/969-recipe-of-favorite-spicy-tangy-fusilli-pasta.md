Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
