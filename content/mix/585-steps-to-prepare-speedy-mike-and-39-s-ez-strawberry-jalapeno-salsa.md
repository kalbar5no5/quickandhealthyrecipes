Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
