Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
