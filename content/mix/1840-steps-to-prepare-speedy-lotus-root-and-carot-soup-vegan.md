Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
