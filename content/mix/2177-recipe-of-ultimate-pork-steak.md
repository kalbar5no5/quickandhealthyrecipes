Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
