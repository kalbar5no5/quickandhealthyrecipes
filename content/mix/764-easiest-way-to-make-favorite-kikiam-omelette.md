How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
