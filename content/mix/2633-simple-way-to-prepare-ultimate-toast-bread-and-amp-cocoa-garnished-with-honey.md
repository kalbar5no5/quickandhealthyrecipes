Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
