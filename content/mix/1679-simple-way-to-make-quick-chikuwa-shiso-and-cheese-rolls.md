Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
