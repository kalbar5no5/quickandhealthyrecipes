Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
