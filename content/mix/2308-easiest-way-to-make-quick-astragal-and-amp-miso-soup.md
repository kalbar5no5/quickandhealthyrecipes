Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
