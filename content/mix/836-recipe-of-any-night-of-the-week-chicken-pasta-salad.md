Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
