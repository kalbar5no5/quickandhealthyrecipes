Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
