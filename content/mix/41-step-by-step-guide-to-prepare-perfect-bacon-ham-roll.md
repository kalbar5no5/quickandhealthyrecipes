Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
