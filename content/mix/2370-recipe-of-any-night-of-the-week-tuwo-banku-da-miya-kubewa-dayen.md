Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
