Tonjiru has a distinct pork flavor and strong taste from Gobo. When the ingredients become tender, remove the kombu, then mix in the miso into the soup. The traditional tonjiru is made with tofu, miso, and dashi stock, combines pork with vegetables such as daikon, burdock, sweet potato, and konnyaku. The whole tonjiru dish is very comforting in this cold winter weather. I threw in some wakame seaweed in the soup as well. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
