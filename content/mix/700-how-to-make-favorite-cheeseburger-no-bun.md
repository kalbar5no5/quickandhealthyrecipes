Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression.

They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!
