Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
