Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
