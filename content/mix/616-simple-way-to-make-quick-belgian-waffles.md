recipeingredient:
- "90 grams Cake flour"
- "90 grams Strong bread flour"
- "30 grams Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "10 grams Dry yeast"
- "130 to 150 grams 1 egg and milk"
- "80 grams Unsalted butter  chilled and finely diced"
- "50 grams Nib sugar"
- "1 dash Vanilla oil or essence"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ingredients except for the nib sugar and vanilla oil into the bread machine. Set the machine to bread dough and complete the first rising."
- "When the mixture has come together, add vanilla oil. The dough may seem really sticky and dense at first, but will eventually become nice and shiny."
- "Take the dough out after the first rising is finished. Divide into 8 portions."
- "Mix in the nib sugar. There&#39;s no need to form the dough into balls! It&#39;s actually better if the nib sugar sticks out rather than being completely folded in."
- "If the dough is too runny, scoop it out with a spoon or a spatula to put directly onto the sandwich maker."
- "Preheat the sandwich maker. Cover the dough with a damp (tightly squeezed) cloth to prevent it from drying up."
- "Bake in the preheated sandwich maker. It will be nice and crunchy if the nib sugar is a little visible on the surface of the dough."
- "Press the edges to test its doneness - it should be a little spongy. It&#39;s ready to be served when the surface is golden brown as in the photo!"
- "I also tried baking it in different shapes as shown here."
- "I&#39;ve had a lot of feedback saying that the batter was too runny, so I reduced the amount of milk and eggs."
- "If they get cold, wrap them up in aluminum foil and warm them up in a toaster oven."

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
