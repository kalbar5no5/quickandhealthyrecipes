Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
