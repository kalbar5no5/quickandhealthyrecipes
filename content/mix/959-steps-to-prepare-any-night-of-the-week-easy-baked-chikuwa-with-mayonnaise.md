Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
