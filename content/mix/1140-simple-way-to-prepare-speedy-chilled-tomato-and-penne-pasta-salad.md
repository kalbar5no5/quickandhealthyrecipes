Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
