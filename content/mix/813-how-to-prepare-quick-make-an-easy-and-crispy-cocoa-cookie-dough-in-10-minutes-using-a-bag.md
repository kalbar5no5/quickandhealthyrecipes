Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
