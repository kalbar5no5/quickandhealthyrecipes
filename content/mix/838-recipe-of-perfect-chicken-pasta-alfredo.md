Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
