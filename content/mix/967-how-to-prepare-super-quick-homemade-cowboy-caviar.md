Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
