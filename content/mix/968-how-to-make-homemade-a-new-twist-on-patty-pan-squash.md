Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
