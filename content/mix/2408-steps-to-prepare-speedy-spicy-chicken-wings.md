Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
