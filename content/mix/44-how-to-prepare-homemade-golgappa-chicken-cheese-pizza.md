Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
