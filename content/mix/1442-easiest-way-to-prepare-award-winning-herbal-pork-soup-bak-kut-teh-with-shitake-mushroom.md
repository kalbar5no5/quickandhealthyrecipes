How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
