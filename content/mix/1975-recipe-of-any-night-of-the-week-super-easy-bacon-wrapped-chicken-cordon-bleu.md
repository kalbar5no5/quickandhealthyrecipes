Sprinkle chicken with pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, and lots of Parmesan cheese (I don&#39;t measure just wing it). These easy keto bacon wrapped stuffed chicken cutlets make for a delicious low carb dinner. The chicken is stuffed with ham and cheese, rolled and wrapped in bacon. The classic way to make Chicken Cordon Bleu involves breast pounded until thin, layered with ham and cheese, rolled into a log, chilled, dredged in flour then egg then breadcrumbs then deep fried (and you need a lot of oil to deep fry them). Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. 

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood.

The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
