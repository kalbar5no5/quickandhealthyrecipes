Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
