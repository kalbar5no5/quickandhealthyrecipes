recipeinstructions:

Cube just under 1/2&#34; and just heat in skillet with seasoning until warmed through. This is one way I use up leftover rotisserie chicken!"
- "Heat a 12&#34; skillet over medium low heat (I moved my chicken to a bowl, and rinsed out and dried the skillet I used for it). When skillet is heated, brush one side of one flour tortilla with about a teaspoon of melted better. Place buttered side down in skillet."

- "Allow to cook opened until cheese begins to melt around the edges. Fold sauce half of tortilla on top of filling half. Gently press down on quesadilla with back of a spatula to squish everything together. Continue cooking on first side until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip, press and cook 2 minutes more for a lightly golden finish on both sides (Longer for a darker finish if you want)."
- "Repeat with remaining ingredients for 4 quesadillas. As each is finished, transfer from skillet to a plate to rest a few minutes before cutting. Cut each quesadilla into 4 pieces (I used my pizza cutter), serve and enjoy!"

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
