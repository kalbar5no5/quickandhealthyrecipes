Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
