Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
