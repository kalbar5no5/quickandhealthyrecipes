How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
