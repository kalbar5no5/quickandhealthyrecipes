recipeinstructions:
- "I pulled everything out of my fridge and pantry that needed to be used up TODAY. Then I tapped my foot with my hands on my hips, tilted my head and chewed on my lip, wrinkled my forehead and.... Well this is where I ended up...."
- "Melt 2 Tbsp butter in an iron skillet, or an oven proof skillet. I use a skillet because I&#39;m going to cook, stick in the fridge and reheat after my kids basketball game."
- "Preheat oven to 375 degrees"
- "Cube bread into 1&#34; or hearty bite sized pieces, needs to hold up during saucing process but not so big you need to cut it up later."
- "Once butter has melted and just started to brown, throw in the bread, move around to cover the bottom of the skillet but do not toss it. You want an even layer of buttered, slightly fried bread. Remove from heat once bread has started to brown."
- "Next, top with meat. I minced up some leftover steak in my food processor and sprinkled it all over. With the flavor combinations in this recipe, red meat definitely works best, but you do not have to mince the meat, just avoid large pieces that will require additional cutting at serving time."
- "Then I pulled out some leftover canned mushrooms.. Sighed... I went to the store today, failed to buy some fresh fungi and this is what I&#39;m left with. Which, as I took the picture I had the realization they may be the ugliest of the foods. Proceed to chop the mushrooms, continue to contemplate using a grocery list.... Sprinkle those ugly little pieces of yumminess on top the bread and steak skillet."
- "In a bowl whisk 1 can French onion soup and 8 oz. of sour cream together. If you only have a partial container of sour cream, just add some milk or cream to make up the difference."
- "Pour the sour cream mixture on top of the skillet meal you have assembled."
- "Bake at 375 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes."
- "Shred 8 oz. of mozzarella or as much cheese as you want, or until your arm gets tired, or until you hit your knuckle on the cheese grater.... Probably works to tear open a package of shredded cheese too... I didn&#39;t buy any at the store today... Grocery lists people..."
- "Now decide how soon you&#39;re going to eat... If you are hungry go ahead and top the skillet with the cheese and pop it back in the oven for a couple minutes or let it sit covered while you pull together the rest of your meal. For me this is a make ahead meal, so I shredded my cheese on a piece of foil. Then I wrapped it up in a little pouch and threw it in the fridge with the cooled, prepared skillet. &#34;Threw&#34; may not be the appropriate verb here."
- "Later..... I pull skillet out of fridge, top with cheese, cover with foil, and heat on the stove top over a medium low heat... While trying to get my kids to shower and put away their sports gear and I try to find my cork screw and wine (which strangely enough I remembered without a grocery list....) Hmmmm....."
- "Enjoy :)"

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
