recipeinstructions:
- "First, make certain that all of the vegetables you choose are very firm and very fresh. That really is the first secret to this unique Garlic Salsa Fresca!"
- "● Using only plastic bowls, by hand, fine chop all vegetables listed and try to keep everything the same size. Continuity in size is just as important to this dish as the freshness and firmness of your vegetables.                                                                                     ● Hand chopping will also reduce the chance of any vegetable brusing. Together, these steps will set your salsa far apart from any others. Even if this is your first attempt!"
- "Seperate the jalapeños and white onions and place them in a plastic bowl or large Ziplock Bag. Add 1/2 cup lime juice to that bowl or bag, mix and allow to sit in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour. Stir or massage bag regularly. This step will really make these veggies pop and sweeten! Yes, sweeten!"
- "Throw everything else in the Vegetable Section that&#39;s properly chopped in a large plastic bowl. De-seed all vegetables that call for it, i.e., cucumbers and tomatoes and discard seeds. Keep the seeds in your jalapeños for that additional kick and flavor! Also, add your canned goods. Do not drain the cans. The Clamato, the Tabasco and what fluid the sea salt pulls from your vegetables will be your only source of fluid in your salsa."
- "Mix in all ingredients in the Seasonings section gently but well. You don&#39;t want to bruise those perfect veggies!"
- "● Mix in jalapeños and onions with the 1/2 cup lime juice they have been marinating in. Mix well. Refrigerate until chilled. Stir regularly. Taste test and add additional lime juice if needed. ● While you&#39;re at it, why not make yourself a wicked Bloody Mary or Bloody Caesar since you already have the majority of the ingredients out? See recipe below.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/342689-mikes-perfect-bloody-caesars"
- "You can also serve this salsa communal style with sturdy chips like homemade Tortilla chips [you&#39;ll need them sturdy with this heavy salsa!] and/or sturdy quality crackers like Stacys Garlic Chips."
- "STORING YOUR SALSA:                          You can also jar [don&#39;t can-this salsa won&#39;t last long enough for that process] some of this salsa. It will last about a week in the fridge. Once fresh jarred, offer it to your friends and co-workers! I know our neighbors look forward to this salsa at least once a month with our homemade, heavily seasoned Tortilla chips!"
- "OPTIONS FOR THE COOK:                                                                                     There are endless seasonings and ingredients you can either omit or even add to this Salsa. Various herbs and spices like Mexican Saffron and even Old Bay have been great additions in various dishes! It&#39;s your call! Vegetables such as corn or zucchini, or, even fruits like sweet Mango, Papaya, Watermelon or Cantelope are all fantastic options to counter any sodium or acidity. Just make absolute certain that your fruit or vegetable additions are just as firm as your veggies, yet sweetly ripened."
- "WANTING A QUICK CEVICHE?                                                                ● Easy! If you&#39;d like to turn this recipe into a memorable Ceviche, simply add a bit more lime juice to your jalapeño and onion bowl, just enough to coat your raw seafood [i.e., shrimp] and allow it to marinate [or cook in citrus] for at least an hour. Lastly, fold your veggies and shrimp in with all other ingredients. Then, refrigerate for a few hours if possible. Easy peasy folks!                                             ● Remember to serve this Garlic Salsa Fresca with additional hot sauces like Tabasco, lime wedges, cilantro and sliced avocado to the side! Quality, sturdy crackers like Stacy&#39;s pair quite well."
- "Lastly, this salsa is exponentially better in the following days! Please, share a picture of all your hard work! Enjoy!"

##### Steps to make Mike&#39;s Garlic Salsa Fresca Or Ceviche:

1. First, make certain that all of the vegetables you choose are very firm and very fresh. That really is the first secret to this unique Garlic Salsa Fresca!
1. ● Using only plastic bowls, by hand, fine chop all vegetables listed and try to keep everything the same size. Continuity in size is just as important to this dish as the freshness and firmness of your vegetables.                                                                                     ● Hand chopping will also reduce the chance of any vegetable brusing.

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
