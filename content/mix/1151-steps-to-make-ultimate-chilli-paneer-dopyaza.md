Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
