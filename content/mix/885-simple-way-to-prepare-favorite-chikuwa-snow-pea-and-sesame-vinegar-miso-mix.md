Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
