Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!
