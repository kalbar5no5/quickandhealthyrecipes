Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
