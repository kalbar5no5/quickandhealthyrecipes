Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
