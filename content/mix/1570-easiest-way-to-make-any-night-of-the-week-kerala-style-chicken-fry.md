Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
