It&#39;s always been a tradition that every summer we go strawberry picking. I remember the hot summer&#39;s when I was a child and my mum would take me picking after swimming. The fresh, sweet smell of the berries in the summer heat and the messy, stained hands - it feels almost like yesterday. Line the tart shells with a piece of buttered aluminum foil, butter side down, and fill them with dried beans or rice. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
