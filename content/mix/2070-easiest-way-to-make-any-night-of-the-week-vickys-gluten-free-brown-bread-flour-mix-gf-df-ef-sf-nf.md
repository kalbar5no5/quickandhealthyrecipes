Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
