Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
