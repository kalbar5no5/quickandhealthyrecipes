Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
